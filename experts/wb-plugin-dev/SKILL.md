## 成员角色：agent-creator

You are an elite AI agent architect specializing in crafting high-performance agent configurations. Your expertise lies in translating user requirements into precisely-tuned agent specifications that maximize effectiveness and reliability.

**Important Context**: You may have access to project-specific instructions from CODEBUDDY.md files and other context that may include coding standards, project structure, and custom requirements. Consider this context when creating agents to ensure they align with the project's established patterns and practices.

When a user describes what they want an agent to do, you will:

1. **Extract Core Intent**: Identify the fundamental purpose, key responsibilities, and success criteria for the agent. Look for both explicit requirements and implicit needs. Consider any project-specific context from CODEBUDDY.md files. For agents that are meant to review code, you should assume that the user is asking to review recently written code and not the whole codebase, unless the user has explicitly instructed you otherwise.

2. **Design Expert Persona**: Create a compelling expert identity that embodies deep domain knowledge relevant to the task. The persona should inspire confidence and guide the agent's decision-making approach.

3. **Architect Comprehensive Instructions**: Develop a system prompt that:
   - Establishes clear behavioral boundaries and operational parameters
   - Provides specific methodologies and best practices for task execution
   - Anticipates edge cases and provides guidance for handling them
   - Incorporates any specific requirements or preferences mentioned by the user
   - Defines output format expectations when relevant
   - Aligns with project-specific coding standards and patterns from CODEBUDDY.md

4. **Optimize for Performance**: Include:
   - Decision-making frameworks appropriate to the domain
   - Quality control mechanisms and self-verification steps
   - Efficient workflow patterns
   - Clear escalation or fallback strategies

5. **Create Identifier**: Design a concise, descriptive identifier that:
   - Uses lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
   - Is typically 2-4 words joined by hyphens
   - Clearly indicates the agent's primary function
   - Is memorable and easy to type
   - Avoids generic terms like "helper" or "assistant"

6. **Craft Triggering Examples**: Create 2-4 `<example>` blocks showing:
   - Different phrasings for same intent
   - Both explicit and proactive triggering
   - Context, user message, assistant response, commentary
   - Why the agent should trigger in each scenario
   - Show assistant using the Agent tool to launch the agent

**Agent Creation Process:**

1. **Understand Request**: Analyze user's description of what agent should do

2. **Design Agent Configuration**:
   - **Identifier**: Create concise, descriptive name (lowercase, hyphens, 3-50 chars)
   - **Description**: Write triggering conditions starting with "Use this agent when..."
   - **Examples**: Create 2-4 `<example>` blocks with:
     ```
     <example>
     Context: [Situation that should trigger agent]
     user: "[User message]"
     assistant: "[Response before triggering]"
     <commentary>
     [Why agent should trigger]
     </commentary>
     assistant: "I'll use the [agent-name] agent to [what it does]."
     </example>
     ```
   - **System Prompt**: Create comprehensive instructions with:
     - Role and expertise
     - Core responsibilities (numbered list)
     - Detailed process (step-by-step)
     - Quality standards
     - Output format
     - Edge case handling

3. **Select Configuration**:
   - **Model**: Use `inherit` unless user specifies (sonnet for complex, haiku for simple)
   - **Color**: Choose appropriate color:
     - blue/cyan: Analysis, review
     - green: Generation, creation
     - yellow: Validation, caution
     - red: Security, critical
     - magenta: Transformation, creative
   - **Tools**: Recommend minimal set needed, or omit for full access

4. **Generate Agent File**: Use Write tool to create `agents/[identifier].md`:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: [identifier]
   description: [Use this agent when... Examples: <example>...</example>]
   model: inherit
   color: [chosen-color]
   tools: ["Tool1", "Tool2"]  # Optional
   ---

   [Complete system prompt]
   ```

5. **Explain to User**: Provide summary of created agent:
   - What it does
   - When it triggers
   - Where it's saved
   - How to test it
   - Suggest running validation: `Use the plugin-validator agent to check the plugin structure`

**Quality Standards:**
- Identifier follows naming rules (lowercase, hyphens, 3-50 chars)
- Description has strong trigger phrases and 2-4 examples
- Examples show both explicit and proactive triggering
- System prompt is comprehensive (500-3,000 words)
- System prompt has clear structure (role, responsibilities, process, output)
- Model choice is appropriate
- Tool selection follows least privilege
- Color choice matches agent purpose

**Output Format:**
Create agent file, then provide summary:

## Agent Created: [identifier]

### Configuration
- **Name:** [identifier]
- **Triggers:** [When it's used]
- **Model:** [choice]
- **Color:** [choice]
- **Tools:** [list or "all tools"]

### File Created
`agents/[identifier].md` ([word count] words)

### How to Use
This agent will trigger when [triggering scenarios].

Test it by: [suggest test scenario]

Validate with: `scripts/validate-agent.sh agents/[identifier].md`

### Next Steps
[Recommendations for testing, integration, or improvements]

**Edge Cases:**
- Vague user request: Ask clarifying questions before generating
- Conflicts with existing agents: Note conflict, suggest different scope/name
- Very complex requirements: Break into multiple specialized agents
- User wants specific tool access: Honor the request in agent configuration
- User specifies model: Use specified model instead of inherit
- First agent in plugin: Create agents/ directory first
```

This agent automates agent creation using the proven patterns from CodeBuddy Code's internal implementation, making it easy for users to create high-quality autonomous agents.

## 成员角色：plugin-validator

You are an expert plugin validator specializing in comprehensive validation of CodeBuddy Code plugin structure, configuration, and components.

**Your Core Responsibilities:**
1. Validate plugin structure and organization
2. Check plugin.json manifest for correctness
3. Validate all component files (commands, agents, skills, hooks)
4. Verify naming conventions and file organization
5. Check for common issues and anti-patterns
6. Provide specific, actionable recommendations

**Validation Process:**

1. **Locate Plugin Root**:
   - Check for `.codebuddy-plugin/plugin.json`

     - Valid event names (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop, etc.)
     - Each hook has `matcher` and `hooks` array
     - Hook type is `command` or `prompt`
     - Commands reference existing scripts with ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}

8. **Validate MCP Configuration** (if `.mcp.json` or `mcpServers` in manifest):
   - Check JSON syntax
   - Verify server configurations:
     - stdio: has `command` field
     - sse/http/ws: has `url` field
     - Type-specific fields present
   - Check ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT} usage for portability

9. **Check File Organization**:
   - README.md exists and is comprehensive
   - No unnecessary files (node_modules, .DS_Store, etc.)
   - .gitignore present if needed
   - LICENSE file present

10. **Security Checks**:
    - No hardcoded credentials in any files
    - MCP servers use HTTPS/WSS not HTTP/WS
    - Hooks don't have obvious security issues
    - No secrets in example files

**Quality Standards:**
- All validation errors include file path and specific issue
- Warnings distinguished from errors
- Provide fix suggestions for each issue

- Plugin not found: Clear error message with guidance
- Corrupted files: Skip and report, continue validation
```

Excellent work! The agent-development skill is now complete and all 6 skills are documented in the README. Would you like me to create more agents (like skill-reviewer) or work on something else?

## 成员角色：skill-reviewer

You are an expert skill architect specializing in reviewing and improving CodeBuddy Code skills for maximum effectiveness and reliability.

**Your Core Responsibilities:**
1. Review skill structure and organization
2. Evaluate description quality and triggering effectiveness
3. Assess progressive disclosure implementation
4. Check adherence to skill-creator best practices
5. Provide specific recommendations for improvement

**Skill Review Process:**

1. **Locate and Read Skill**:
   - Find SKILL.md file (user should indicate path)
   - Read frontmatter and body content
   - Check for supporting directories (references/, examples/, scripts/)

2. **Validate Structure**:
   - Frontmatter format (YAML between `---`)
   - Required fields: `name`, `description`
   - Optional fields: `version`, `when_to_use` (note: deprecated, use description only)
   - Body content exists and is substantial

3. **Evaluate Description** (Most Critical):
   - **Trigger Phrases**: Does description include specific phrases users would say?
   - **Third Person**: Uses "This skill should be used when..." not "Load this skill when..."
   - **Specificity**: Concrete scenarios, not vague
   - **Length**: Appropriate (not too short <50 chars, not too long >500 chars for description)
   - **Example Triggers**: Lists specific user queries that should trigger skill

4. **Assess Content Quality**:
   - **Word Count**: SKILL.md body should be 1,000-3,000 words (lean, focused)
   - **Writing Style**: Imperative/infinitive form ("To do X, do Y" not "You should do X")
   - **Organization**: Clear sections, logical flow
   - **Specificity**: Concrete guidance, not vague advice

5. **Check Progressive Disclosure**:
   - **Core SKILL.md**: Essential information only
   - **references/**: Detailed docs moved out of core
   - **examples/**: Working code examples separate
   - **scripts/**: Utility scripts if needed
   - **Pointers**: SKILL.md references these resources clearly

6. **Review Supporting Files** (if present):
   - **references/**: Check quality, relevance, organization
   - **examples/**: Verify examples are complete and correct
   - **scripts/**: Check scripts are executable and documented

7. **Identify Issues**:
   - Categorize by severity (critical/major/minor)
   - Note anti-patterns:
     - Vague trigger descriptions
     - Too much content in SKILL.md (should be in references/)
     - Second person in description
     - Missing key triggers
     - No examples/references when they'd be valuable

8. **Generate Recommendations**:
   - Specific fixes for each issue
   - Before/after examples when helpful
   - Prioritized by impact

**Quality Standards:**
- Description must have strong, specific trigger phrases
- SKILL.md should be lean (under 3,000 words ideally)
- Writing style must be imperative/infinitive form
- Progressive disclosure properly implemented
- All file references work correctly
- Examples are complete and accurate

**Output Format:**
## Skill Review: [skill-name]

### Summary
[Overall assessment and word counts]

### Description Analysis
**Current:** [Show current description]

**Issues:**
- [Issue 1 with description]
- [Issue 2...]

**Recommendations:**
- [Specific fix 1]
- Suggested improved description: "[better version]"

### Content Quality

**SKILL.md Analysis:**
- Word count: [count] ([assessment: too long/good/too short])
- Writing style: [assessment]
- Organization: [assessment]

**Issues:**
- [Content issue 1]
- [Content issue 2]

**Recommendations:**
- [Specific improvement 1]
- Consider moving [section X] to references/[filename].md

### Progressive Disclosure

**Current Structure:**

- references/: [count] files, [total words]
- examples/: [count] files
- scripts/: [count] files

**Assessment:**
[Is progressive disclosure effective?]

**Recommendations:**
[Suggestions for better organization]

### Specific Issues

#### Critical ([count])
- [File/location]: [Issue] - [Fix]

#### Major ([count])
- [File/location]: [Issue] - [Recommendation]

#### Minor ([count])
- [File/location]: [Issue] - [Suggestion]

### Positive Aspects
- [What's done well 1]
- [What's done well 2]

### Overall Rating
[Pass/Needs Improvement/Needs Major Revision]

### Priority Recommendations
1. [Highest priority fix]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

**Edge Cases:**
- Skill with no description issues: Focus on content and organization
- Very long skill (>5,000 words): Strongly recommend splitting into references
- New skill (minimal content): Provide constructive building guidance

# Agent Development for CodeBuddy Code Plugins

## Overview

Agents are autonomous subprocesses that handle complex, multi-step tasks independently. Understanding agent structure, triggering conditions, and system prompt design enables creating powerful autonomous capabilities.

**Key concepts:**
- Agents are FOR autonomous work, commands are FOR user-initiated actions
- Markdown file format with YAML frontmatter
- Triggering via description field with examples
- System prompt defines agent behavior
- Model and color customization

## Agent File Structure

### Complete Format

```markdown
---
name: agent-identifier
description: Use this agent when [triggering conditions]. Examples:

<example>
Context: [Situation description]
user: "[User request]"
assistant: "[How assistant should respond and use this agent]"
<commentary>
[Why this agent should be triggered]
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
[Additional example...]
</example>

model: inherit
color: blue
tools: ["Read", "Write", "Grep"]
---

You are [agent role description]...

**Your Core Responsibilities:**
1. [Responsibility 1]
2. [Responsibility 2]

**Analysis Process:**
[Step-by-step workflow]

**Output Format:**
[What to return]
```

## Frontmatter Fields

### name (required)

Agent identifier used for namespacing and invocation.

**Format:** lowercase, numbers, hyphens only
**Length:** 3-50 characters
**Pattern:** Must start and end with alphanumeric

**Good examples:**
- `code-reviewer`
- `test-generator`
- `api-docs-writer`
- `security-analyzer`

**Bad examples:**
- `helper` (too generic)
- `-agent-` (starts/ends with hyphen)
- `my_agent` (underscores not allowed)
- `ag` (too short, < 3 chars)

### description (required)

Defines when CodeBuddy should trigger this agent. **This is the most critical field.**

**Must include:**
1. Triggering conditions ("Use this agent when...")
2. Multiple `<example>` blocks showing usage
3. Context, user request, and assistant response in each example
4. `<commentary>` explaining why agent triggers

**Format:**
```
Use this agent when [conditions]. Examples:

<example>
Context: [Scenario description]
user: "[What user says]"
assistant: "[How CodeBuddy should respond]"
<commentary>
[Why this agent is appropriate]
</commentary>
</example>

[More examples...]
```

**Best practices:**
- Include 2-4 concrete examples
- Show proactive and reactive triggering
- Cover different phrasings of same intent
- Explain reasoning in commentary
- Be specific about when NOT to use the agent

### model (required)

Which model the agent should use.

**Options:**
- `inherit` - Use same model as parent (recommended)
- `sonnet` - CodeBuddy Sonnet (balanced)
- `opus` - CodeBuddy Opus (most capable, expensive)
- `haiku` - CodeBuddy Haiku (fast, cheap)

**Recommendation:** Use `inherit` unless agent needs specific model capabilities.

### color (required)

Visual identifier for agent in UI.

**Options:** `blue`, `cyan`, `green`, `yellow`, `magenta`, `red`

**Guidelines:**
- Choose distinct colors for different agents in same plugin
- Use consistent colors for similar agent types
- Blue/cyan: Analysis, review
- Green: Success-oriented tasks
- Yellow: Caution, validation
- Red: Critical, security
- Magenta: Creative, generation

### tools (optional)

Restrict agent to specific tools.

**Format:** Array of tool names

```yaml
tools: ["Read", "Write", "Grep", "Bash"]
```

**Default:** If omitted, agent has access to all tools

**Best practice:** Limit tools to minimum needed (principle of least privilege)

**Common tool sets:**
- Read-only analysis: `["Read", "Grep", "Glob"]`
- Code generation: `["Read", "Write", "Grep"]`
- Testing: `["Read", "Bash", "Grep"]`
- Full access: Omit field or use `["*"]`

## System Prompt Design

The markdown body becomes the agent's system prompt. Write in second person, addressing the agent directly.

### Structure

**Standard template:**
```markdown
You are [role] specializing in [domain].

**Your Core Responsibilities:**
1. [Primary responsibility]
2. [Secondary responsibility]
3. [Additional responsibilities...]

**Analysis Process:**
1. [Step one]
2. [Step two]
3. [Step three]
[...]

**Quality Standards:**
- [Standard 1]
- [Standard 2]

**Output Format:**
Provide results in this format:
- [What to include]
- [How to structure]

**Edge Cases:**
Handle these situations:
- [Edge case 1]: [How to handle]
- [Edge case 2]: [How to handle]
```

### Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Write in second person ("You are...", "You will...")
- Be specific about responsibilities
- Provide step-by-step process
- Define output format
- Include quality standards
- Address edge cases
- Keep under 10,000 characters

❌ **DON'T:**
- Write in first person ("I am...", "I will...")
- Be vague or generic
- Omit process steps
- Leave output format undefined
- Skip quality guidance
- Ignore error cases

## Creating Agents

### Method 1: AI-Assisted Generation

Use this prompt pattern (extracted from CodeBuddy Code):

```
Create an agent configuration based on this request: "[YOUR DESCRIPTION]"

Requirements:
1. Extract core intent and responsibilities
2. Design expert persona for the domain
3. Create comprehensive system prompt with:
   - Clear behavioral boundaries
   - Specific methodologies
   - Edge case handling
   - Output format
4. Create identifier (lowercase, hyphens, 3-50 chars)
5. Write description with triggering conditions
6. Include 2-3 <example> blocks showing when to use

Return JSON with:
{
  "identifier": "agent-name",
  "whenToUse": "Use this agent when... Examples: <example>...</example>",
  "systemPrompt": "You are..."
}
```

Then convert to agent file format with frontmatter.

See `examples/agent-creation-prompt.md` for complete template.

### Method 2: Manual Creation

1. Choose agent identifier (3-50 chars, lowercase, hyphens)
2. Write description with examples
3. Select model (usually `inherit`)
4. Choose color for visual identification
5. Define tools (if restricting access)
6. Write system prompt with structure above
7. Save as `agents/agent-name.md`

## Validation Rules

### Identifier Validation

```
✅ Valid: code-reviewer, test-gen, api-analyzer-v2
❌ Invalid: ag (too short), -start (starts with hyphen), my_agent (underscore)
```

**Rules:**
- 3-50 characters
- Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only
- Must start and end with alphanumeric
- No underscores, spaces, or special characters

### Description Validation

**Length:** 10-5,000 characters
**Must include:** Triggering conditions and examples
**Best:** 200-1,000 characters with 2-4 examples

### System Prompt Validation

**Length:** 20-10,000 characters
**Best:** 500-3,000 characters
**Structure:** Clear responsibilities, process, output format

## Agent Organization

### Plugin Agents Directory

```
plugin-name/
└── agents/
    ├── analyzer.md
    ├── reviewer.md
    └── generator.md
```

All `.md` files in `agents/` are auto-discovered.

### Namespacing

Agents are namespaced automatically:
- Single plugin: `agent-name`
- With subdirectories: `plugin:subdir:agent-name`

## Testing Agents

### Test Triggering

Create test scenarios to verify agent triggers correctly:

1. Write agent with specific triggering examples
2. Use similar phrasing to examples in test
3. Check CodeBuddy loads the agent
4. Verify agent provides expected functionality

### Test System Prompt

Ensure system prompt is complete:

1. Give agent typical task
2. Check it follows process steps
3. Verify output format is correct
4. Test edge cases mentioned in prompt
5. Confirm quality standards are met

## Quick Reference

### Minimal Agent

```markdown
---
name: simple-agent
description: Use this agent when... Examples: <example>...</example>
model: inherit
color: blue
---

You are an agent that [does X].

Process:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]

Output: [What to provide]
```

### Frontmatter Fields Summary

| Field | Required | Format | Example |
|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| name | Yes | lowercase-hyphens | code-reviewer |
| description | Yes | Text + examples | Use when... <example>... |
| model | Yes | inherit/sonnet/opus/haiku | inherit |
| color | Yes | Color name | blue |
| tools | No | Array of tool names | ["Read", "Grep"] |

### Best Practices

**DO:**
- ✅ Include 2-4 concrete examples in description
- ✅ Write specific triggering conditions
- ✅ Use `inherit` for model unless specific need
- ✅ Choose appropriate tools (least privilege)
- ✅ Write clear, structured system prompts
- ✅ Test agent triggering thoroughly

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Use generic descriptions without examples
- ❌ Omit triggering conditions
- ❌ Give all agents same color
- ❌ Grant unnecessary tool access
- ❌ Write vague system prompts
- ❌ Skip testing

3. Create `agents/agent-name.md` file
4. Write frontmatter with all required fields
5. Write system prompt following best practices
6. Include 2-4 triggering examples in description
7. Validate with `scripts/validate-agent.sh`
8. Test triggering with real scenarios
9. Document agent in plugin README

Focus on clear triggering conditions and comprehensive system prompts for autonomous operation.

## 模块：command-development

# Command Development for CodeBuddy Code

## Overview

Slash commands are frequently-used prompts defined as Markdown files that CodeBuddy executes during interactive sessions. Understanding command structure, frontmatter options, and dynamic features enables creating powerful, reusable workflows.

**Key concepts:**
- Markdown file format for commands
- YAML frontmatter for configuration
- Dynamic arguments and file references
- Bash execution for context
- Command organization and namespacing

## Command Basics

### What is a Slash Command?

A slash command is a Markdown file containing a prompt that CodeBuddy executes when invoked. Commands provide:
- **Reusability**: Define once, use repeatedly
- **Consistency**: Standardize common workflows
- **Sharing**: Distribute across team or projects
- **Efficiency**: Quick access to complex prompts

### Critical: Commands are Instructions FOR CodeBuddy

**Commands are written for agent consumption, not human consumption.**

When a user invokes `/command-name`, the command content becomes CodeBuddy's instructions. Write commands as directives TO CodeBuddy about what to do, not as messages TO the user.

**Correct approach (instructions for CodeBuddy):**
```markdown
Review this code for security vulnerabilities including:
- SQL injection
- XSS attacks
- Authentication issues

Provide specific line numbers and severity ratings.
```

**Incorrect approach (messages to user):**
```markdown
This command will review your code for security issues.
You'll receive a report with vulnerability details.
```

The first example tells CodeBuddy what to do. The second tells the user what will happen but doesn't instruct CodeBuddy. Always use the first approach.

### Command Locations

**Project commands** (shared with team):
- Location: `.codebuddy/commands/`
- Scope: Available in specific project
- Label: Shown as "(project)" in `/help`
- Use for: Team workflows, project-specific tasks

**Personal commands** (available everywhere):
- Location: `~/.codebuddy/commands/`
- Scope: Available in all projects
- Label: Shown as "(user)" in `/help`
- Use for: Personal workflows, cross-project utilities

**Plugin commands** (bundled with plugins):
- Location: `plugin-name/commands/`
- Scope: Available when plugin installed
- Label: Shown as "(plugin-name)" in `/help`
- Use for: Plugin-specific functionality

## File Format

### Basic Structure

Commands are Markdown files with `.md` extension:

```
.codebuddy/commands/
├── review.md           # /review command
├── test.md             # /test command
└── deploy.md           # /deploy command
```

**Simple command:**
```markdown
Review this code for security vulnerabilities including:
- SQL injection
- XSS attacks
- Authentication bypass
- Insecure data handling
```

No frontmatter needed for basic commands.

### With YAML Frontmatter

Add configuration using YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
description: Review code for security issues
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Bash(git:*)
model: sonnet
---

Review this code for security vulnerabilities...
```

## YAML Frontmatter Fields

### description

**Purpose:** Brief description shown in `/help`
**Type:** String
**Default:** First line of command prompt

```yaml
---
description: Review pull request for code quality
---
```

**Best practice:** Clear, actionable description (under 60 characters)

### allowed-tools

**Purpose:** Specify which tools command can use
**Type:** String or Array
**Default:** Inherits from conversation

```yaml
---
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash(git:*)
---
```

**Patterns:**
- `Read, Write, Edit` - Specific tools
- `Bash(git:*)` - Bash with git commands only
- `*` - All tools (rarely needed)

**Use when:** Command requires specific tool access

### model

**Purpose:** Specify model for command execution
**Type:** String (sonnet, opus, haiku)
**Default:** Inherits from conversation

```yaml
---
model: haiku
---
```

**Use cases:**
- `haiku` - Fast, simple commands
- `sonnet` - Standard workflows
- `opus` - Complex analysis

### argument-hint

**Purpose:** Document expected arguments for autocomplete
**Type:** String
**Default:** None

```yaml
---
argument-hint: [pr-number] [priority] [assignee]
---
```

**Benefits:**
- Helps users understand command arguments
- Improves command discovery
- Documents command interface

### disable-model-invocation

**Purpose:** Prevent SlashCommand tool from programmatically calling command
**Type:** Boolean
**Default:** false

```yaml
---
disable-model-invocation: true
---
```

**Use when:** Command should only be manually invoked

## Dynamic Arguments

### Using $ARGUMENTS

Capture all arguments as single string:

```markdown
---
description: Fix issue by number
argument-hint: [issue-number]
---

Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following our coding standards and best practices.
```

**Usage:**
```
> /fix-issue 123
> /fix-issue 456
```

**Expands to:**
```
Fix issue #123 following our coding standards...
Fix issue #456 following our coding standards...
```

### Using Positional Arguments

Capture individual arguments with `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc.:

```markdown
---
description: Review PR with priority and assignee
argument-hint: [pr-number] [priority] [assignee]
---

Review pull request #$1 with priority level $2.
After review, assign to $3 for follow-up.
```

**Usage:**
```
> /review-pr 123 high alice
```

**Expands to:**
```
Review pull request #123 with priority level high.
After review, assign to alice for follow-up.
```

### Combining Arguments

Mix positional and remaining arguments:

```markdown
Deploy $1 to $2 environment with options: $3
```

**Usage:**
```
> /deploy api staging --force --skip-tests
```

**Expands to:**
```
Deploy api to staging environment with options: --force --skip-tests
```

## File References

### Using @ Syntax

Include file contents in command:

```markdown
---
description: Review specific file
argument-hint: [file-path]
---

Review @$1 for:
- Code quality
- Best practices
- Potential bugs
```

**Usage:**
```
> /review-file src/api/users.ts
```

**Effect:** CodeBuddy reads `src/api/users.ts` before processing command

### Multiple File References

Reference multiple files:

```markdown
Compare @src/old-version.js with @src/new-version.js

Identify:
- Breaking changes
- New features
- Bug fixes
```

### Static File References

Reference known files without arguments:

```markdown
Review @package.json and @tsconfig.json for consistency

Ensure:
- TypeScript version matches
- Dependencies are aligned
- Build configuration is correct
```

## Bash Execution in Commands

Commands can execute bash commands inline to dynamically gather context before CodeBuddy processes the command. This is useful for including repository state, environment information, or project-specific context.

**When to use:**
- Include dynamic context (git status, environment vars, etc.)
- Gather project/repository state
- Build context-aware workflows

**Implementation details:**
For complete syntax, examples, and best practices, see `references/plugin-features-reference.md` section on bash execution. The reference includes the exact syntax and multiple working examples to avoid execution issues

## Command Organization

### Flat Structure

Simple organization for small command sets:

```
.codebuddy/commands/
├── build.md
├── test.md
├── deploy.md
├── review.md
└── docs.md
```

**Use when:** 5-15 commands, no clear categories

### Namespaced Structure

Organize commands in subdirectories:

```
.codebuddy/commands/
├── ci/
│   ├── build.md        # /build (project:ci)
│   ├── test.md         # /test (project:ci)
│   └── lint.md         # /lint (project:ci)
├── git/
│   ├── commit.md       # /commit (project:git)
│   └── pr.md           # /pr (project:git)
└── docs/
    ├── generate.md     # /generate (project:docs)
    └── publish.md      # /publish (project:docs)
```

**Benefits:**
- Logical grouping by category
- Namespace shown in `/help`
- Easier to find related commands

**Use when:** 15+ commands, clear categories

## Best Practices

### Command Design

1. **Single responsibility:** One command, one task
2. **Clear descriptions:** Self-explanatory in `/help`
3. **Explicit dependencies:** Use `allowed-tools` when needed
4. **Document arguments:** Always provide `argument-hint`
5. **Consistent naming:** Use verb-noun pattern (review-pr, fix-issue)

### Argument Handling

1. **Validate arguments:** Check for required arguments in prompt
2. **Provide defaults:** Suggest defaults when arguments missing
3. **Document format:** Explain expected argument format
4. **Handle edge cases:** Consider missing or invalid arguments

```markdown
---
argument-hint: [pr-number]
---

$IF($1,
  Review PR #$1,
  Please provide a PR number. Usage: /review-pr [number]
)
```

### File References

1. **Explicit paths:** Use clear file paths
2. **Check existence:** Handle missing files gracefully
3. **Relative paths:** Use project-relative paths
4. **Glob support:** Consider using Glob tool for patterns

### Bash Commands

1. **Limit scope:** Use `Bash(git:*)` not `Bash(*)`
2. **Safe commands:** Avoid destructive operations
3. **Handle errors:** Consider command failures
4. **Keep fast:** Long-running commands slow invocation

### Documentation

1. **Add comments:** Explain complex logic
2. **Provide examples:** Show usage in comments
3. **List requirements:** Document dependencies
4. **Version commands:** Note breaking changes

```markdown
---
description: Deploy application to environment
argument-hint: [environment] [version]
---

<!--
Usage: /deploy [staging|production] [version]
Requires: AWS credentials configured
Example: /deploy staging v1.2.3
-->

Deploy application to $1 environment using version $2...
```

## Common Patterns

### Review Pattern

```markdown
---
description: Review code changes
allowed-tools: Read, Bash(git:*)
---

Files changed: !`git diff --name-only`

Review each file for:
1. Code quality and style
2. Potential bugs or issues
3. Test coverage
4. Documentation needs

Provide specific feedback for each file.
```

### Testing Pattern

```markdown
---
description: Run tests for specific file
argument-hint: [test-file]
allowed-tools: Bash(npm:*)
---

Run tests: !`npm test $1`

Analyze results and suggest fixes for failures.
```

### Documentation Pattern

```markdown
---
description: Generate documentation for file
argument-hint: [source-file]
---

Generate comprehensive documentation for @$1 including:
- Function/class descriptions
- Parameter documentation
- Return value descriptions
- Usage examples
- Edge cases and errors
```

### Workflow Pattern

```markdown
---
description: Complete PR workflow
argument-hint: [pr-number]
allowed-tools: Bash(gh:*), Read
---

PR #$1 Workflow:

1. Fetch PR: !`gh pr view $1`
2. Review changes
3. Run checks
4. Approve or request changes
```

## Troubleshooting

**Command not appearing:**
- Check file is in correct directory
- Verify `.md` extension present
- Ensure valid Markdown format
- Restart CodeBuddy Code

**Arguments not working:**
- Verify `$1`, `$2` syntax correct
- Check `argument-hint` matches usage
- Ensure no extra spaces

**Bash execution failing:**
- Check `allowed-tools` includes Bash
- Verify command syntax in backticks
- Test command in terminal first
- Check for required permissions

**File references not working:**
- Verify `@` syntax correct
- Check file path is valid
- Ensure Read tool allowed
- Use absolute or project-relative paths

## Plugin-Specific Features

### CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT Variable

Plugin commands have access to `${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, an environment variable that resolves to the plugin's absolute path.

**Purpose:**
- Reference plugin files portably
- Execute plugin scripts
- Load plugin configuration
- Access plugin templates

**Basic usage:**

```markdown
---
description: Analyze using plugin script
allowed-tools: Bash(node:*)
---

Run analysis: !`node ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/analyze.js $1`

Review results and report findings.
```

**Common patterns:**

```markdown
# Execute plugin script
!`bash ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/script.sh`

# Load plugin configuration
@${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config/settings.json

# Use plugin template
@${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/report.md

# Access plugin resources
@${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/reference.md
```

**Why use it:**
- Works across all installations
- Portable between systems
- No hardcoded paths needed
- Essential for multi-file plugins

### Plugin Command Organization

Plugin commands discovered automatically from `commands/` directory:

```
plugin-name/
├── commands/
│   ├── foo.md              # /foo (plugin:plugin-name)
│   ├── bar.md              # /bar (plugin:plugin-name)
│   └── utils/
│       └── helper.md       # /helper (plugin:plugin-name:utils)
└── plugin.json
```

**Namespace benefits:**
- Logical command grouping
- Shown in `/help` output
- Avoid name conflicts
- Organize related commands

**Naming conventions:**
- Use descriptive action names
- Avoid generic names (test, run)
- Consider plugin-specific prefix
- Use hyphens for multi-word names

### Plugin Command Patterns

**Configuration-based pattern:**

```markdown
---
description: Deploy using plugin configuration
argument-hint: [environment]
allowed-tools: Read, Bash(*)
---

Load configuration: @${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config/$1-deploy.json

Deploy to $1 using configuration settings.
Monitor deployment and report status.
```

**Template-based pattern:**

```markdown
---
description: Generate docs from template
argument-hint: [component]
---

Template: @${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/docs.md

Generate documentation for $1 following template structure.
```

**Multi-script pattern:**

```markdown
---
description: Complete build workflow
allowed-tools: Bash(*)
---

Build: !`bash ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/build.sh`
Test: !`bash ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/test.sh`
Package: !`bash ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/package.sh`

Review outputs and report workflow status.
```

**See `references/plugin-features-reference.md` for detailed patterns.**

## Integration with Plugin Components

Commands can integrate with other plugin components for powerful workflows.

### Agent Integration

Launch plugin agents for complex tasks:

```markdown
---
description: Deep code review
argument-hint: [file-path]
---

Initiate comprehensive review of @$1 using the code-reviewer agent.

The agent will analyze:
- Code structure
- Security issues
- Performance
- Best practices

Agent uses plugin resources:
- ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config/rules.json
- ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/checklists/review.md
```

**Key points:**
- Agent must exist in `plugin/agents/` directory
- CodeBuddy uses Task tool to launch agent
- Document agent capabilities
- Reference plugin resources agent uses

### Skill Integration

Leverage plugin skills for specialized knowledge:

```markdown
---
description: Document API with standards
argument-hint: [api-file]
---

Document API in @$1 following plugin standards.

Use the api-docs-standards skill to ensure:
- Complete endpoint documentation
- Consistent formatting
- Example quality
- Error documentation

Generate production-ready API docs.
```

**Key points:**
- Skill must exist in `plugin/skills/` directory
- Mention skill name to trigger invocation
- Document skill purpose
- Explain what skill provides

### Hook Coordination

Design commands that work with plugin hooks:
- Commands can prepare state for hooks to process
- Hooks execute automatically on tool events
- Commands should document expected hook behavior
- Guide CodeBuddy on interpreting hook output

See `references/plugin-features-reference.md` for examples of commands that coordinate with hooks

### Multi-Component Workflows

Combine agents, skills, and scripts:

```markdown
---
description: Comprehensive review workflow
argument-hint: [file]
allowed-tools: Bash(node:*), Read
---

Target: @$1

Phase 1 - Static Analysis:
!`node ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lint.js $1`

Phase 2 - Deep Review:
Launch code-reviewer agent for detailed analysis.

Phase 3 - Standards Check:
Use coding-standards skill for validation.

Phase 4 - Report:
Template: @${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/review.md

Compile findings into report following template.
```

**When to use:**
- Complex multi-step workflows
- Leverage multiple plugin capabilities
- Require specialized analysis
- Need structured outputs

## Validation Patterns

Commands should validate inputs and resources before processing.

### Argument Validation

```markdown
---
description: Deploy with validation
argument-hint: [environment]
---

Validate environment: !`echo "$1" | grep -E "^(dev|staging|prod)$" || echo "INVALID"`

If $1 is valid environment:
  Deploy to $1
Otherwise:
  Explain valid environments: dev, staging, prod
  Show usage: /deploy [environment]
```

### File Existence Checks

```markdown
---
description: Process configuration
argument-hint: [config-file]
---

Check file exists: !`test -f $1 && echo "EXISTS" || echo "MISSING"`

If file exists:
  Process configuration: @$1
Otherwise:
  Explain where to place config file
  Show expected format
  Provide example configuration
```

### Plugin Resource Validation

```markdown
---
description: Run plugin analyzer
allowed-tools: Bash(test:*)
---

Validate plugin setup:
- Script: !`test -x ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/analyze && echo "✓" || echo "✗"`
- Config: !`test -f ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config.json && echo "✓" || echo "✗"`

If all checks pass, run analysis.
Otherwise, report missing components.
```

### Error Handling

```markdown
---
description: Build with error handling
allowed-tools: Bash(*)
---

Execute build: !`bash ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/build.sh 2>&1 || echo "BUILD_FAILED"`

If build succeeded:
  Report success and output location
If build failed:
  Analyze error output
  Suggest likely causes
  Provide troubleshooting steps
```

**Best practices:**
- Validate early in command
- Provide helpful error messages
- Suggest corrective actions
- Handle edge cases gracefully

## 模块：hook-development

# Hook Development for CodeBuddy Code Plugins

## Overview

Hooks are event-driven automation scripts that execute in response to CodeBuddy Code events. Use hooks to validate operations, enforce policies, add context, and integrate external tools into workflows.

**Key capabilities:**
- Validate tool calls before execution (PreToolUse)
- React to tool results (PostToolUse)
- Enforce completion standards (Stop, SubagentStop)
- Load project context (SessionStart)
- Automate workflows across the development lifecycle

## Hook Types

### Prompt-Based Hooks (Recommended)

Use LLM-driven decision making for context-aware validation:

```json
{
  "type": "prompt",
  "prompt": "Evaluate if this tool use is appropriate: $TOOL_INPUT",
  "timeout": 30
}
```

**Supported events:** Stop, SubagentStop, UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse

**Benefits:**
- Context-aware decisions based on natural language reasoning
- Flexible evaluation logic without bash scripting
- Better edge case handling
- Easier to maintain and extend

### Command Hooks

Execute bash commands for deterministic checks:

```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": "bash ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/validate.sh",
  "timeout": 60
}
```

**Use for:**
- Fast deterministic validations
- File system operations
- External tool integrations
- Performance-critical checks

## Hook Configuration Formats

### Plugin hooks.json Format

**For plugin hooks** in `hooks/hooks.json`, use wrapper format:

```json
{
  "description": "Brief explanation of hooks (optional)",
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [...],
    "Stop": [...],
    "SessionStart": [...]
  }
}
```

**Key points:**
- `description` field is optional
- `hooks` field is required wrapper containing actual hook events
- This is the **plugin-specific format**

**Example:**
```json
{
  "description": "Validation hooks for code quality",
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/validate.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Settings Format (Direct)

**For user settings** in `.codebuddy/settings.json`, use direct format:

```json
{
  "PreToolUse": [...],
  "Stop": [...],
  "SessionStart": [...]
}
```

**Key points:**
- No wrapper - events directly at top level
- No description field
- This is the **settings format**

**Important:** The examples below show the hook event structure that goes inside either format. For plugin hooks.json, wrap these in `{"hooks": {...}}`.

## Hook Events

### PreToolUse

Execute before any tool runs. Use to approve, deny, or modify tool calls.

**Example (prompt-based):**
```json
{
  "PreToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Write|Edit",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "prompt",
          "prompt": "Validate file write safety. Check: system paths, credentials, path traversal, sensitive content. Return 'approve' or 'deny'."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Output for PreToolUse:**
```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "permissionDecision": "allow|deny|ask",
    "updatedInput": {"field": "modified_value"}
  },
  "systemMessage": "Explanation for CodeBuddy"
}
```

### PostToolUse

Execute after tool completes. Use to react to results, provide feedback, or log.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "PostToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Edit",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "prompt",
          "prompt": "Analyze edit result for potential issues: syntax errors, security vulnerabilities, breaking changes. Provide feedback."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Output behavior:**
- Exit 0: stdout shown in transcript
- Exit 2: stderr fed back to CodeBuddy
- systemMessage included in context

### Stop

Execute when main agent considers stopping. Use to validate completeness.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "Stop": [
    {
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "prompt",
          "prompt": "Verify task completion: tests run, build succeeded, questions answered. Return 'approve' to stop or 'block' with reason to continue."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Decision output:**
```json
{
  "decision": "approve|block",
  "reason": "Explanation",
  "systemMessage": "Additional context"
}
```

### SubagentStop

Execute when subagent considers stopping. Use to ensure subagent completed its task.

Similar to Stop hook, but for subagents.

### UserPromptSubmit

Execute when user submits a prompt. Use to add context, validate, or block prompts.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "UserPromptSubmit": [
    {
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "prompt",
          "prompt": "Check if prompt requires security guidance. If discussing auth, permissions, or API security, return relevant warnings."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### SessionStart

Execute when CodeBuddy Code session begins. Use to load context and set environment.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "SessionStart": [
    {
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "bash ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/load-context.sh"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Special capability:** Persist environment variables using `$CODEBUDDY_ENV_FILE`:
```bash
echo "export PROJECT_TYPE=nodejs" >> "$CODEBUDDY_ENV_FILE"
```

See `examples/load-context.sh` for complete example.

### SessionEnd

Execute when session ends. Use for cleanup, logging, and state preservation.

### PreCompact

Execute before context compaction. Use to add critical information to preserve.

### Notification

Execute when CodeBuddy sends notifications. Use to react to user notifications.

## Hook Output Format

### Standard Output (All Hooks)

```json
{
  "continue": true,
  "suppressOutput": false,
  "systemMessage": "Message for CodeBuddy"
}
```

- `continue`: If false, halt processing (default true)
- `suppressOutput`: Hide output from transcript (default false)
- `systemMessage`: Message shown to CodeBuddy

### Exit Codes

- `0` - Success (stdout shown in transcript)
- `2` - Blocking error (stderr fed back to CodeBuddy)
- Other - Non-blocking error

## Hook Input Format

All hooks receive JSON via stdin with common fields:

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/path/to/transcript.txt",
  "cwd": "/current/working/dir",
  "permission_mode": "ask|allow",
  "hook_event_name": "PreToolUse"
}
```

**Event-specific fields:**

- **PreToolUse/PostToolUse:** `tool_name`, `tool_input`, `tool_result`
- **UserPromptSubmit:** `user_prompt`
- **Stop/SubagentStop:** `reason`

Access fields in prompts using `$TOOL_INPUT`, `$TOOL_RESULT`, `$USER_PROMPT`, etc.

## Environment Variables

Available in all command hooks:

- `$CODEBUDDY_PROJECT_DIR` - Project root path
- `$CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT` - Plugin directory (use for portable paths)
- `$CODEBUDDY_ENV_FILE` - SessionStart only: persist env vars here
- `$CODEBUDDY_CODE_REMOTE` - Set if running in remote context

**Always use ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT} in hook commands for portability:**

```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": "bash ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/validate.sh"
}
```

## Plugin Hook Configuration

In plugins, define hooks in `hooks/hooks.json`:

```json
{
  "PreToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Write|Edit",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "prompt",
          "prompt": "Validate file write safety"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "Stop": [
    {
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "prompt",
          "prompt": "Verify task completion"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "SessionStart": [
    {
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "bash ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/load-context.sh",
          "timeout": 10
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Plugin hooks merge with user's hooks and run in parallel.

## Matchers

### Tool Name Matching

**Exact match:**
```json
"matcher": "Write"
```

**Multiple tools:**
```json
"matcher": "Read|Write|Edit"
```

**Wildcard (all tools):**
```json
"matcher": "*"
```

**Regex patterns:**
```json
"matcher": "mcp__.*__delete.*"  // All MCP delete tools
```

**Note:** Matchers are case-sensitive.

### Common Patterns

```json
// All MCP tools
"matcher": "mcp__.*"

// Specific plugin's MCP tools
"matcher": "mcp__plugin_asana_.*"

// All file operations
"matcher": "Read|Write|Edit"

// Bash commands only
"matcher": "Bash"
```

## Security Best Practices

### Input Validation

Always validate inputs in command hooks:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

input=$(cat)
tool_name=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.tool_name')

# Validate tool name format
if [[ ! "$tool_name" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$ ]]; then
  echo '{"decision": "deny", "reason": "Invalid tool name"}' >&2
  exit 2
fi
```

### Path Safety

Check for path traversal and sensitive files:

```bash
file_path=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.tool_input.file_path')

# Deny path traversal
if [[ "$file_path" == *".."* ]]; then
  echo '{"decision": "deny", "reason": "Path traversal detected"}' >&2
  exit 2
fi

# Deny sensitive files
if [[ "$file_path" == *".env"* ]]; then
  echo '{"decision": "deny", "reason": "Sensitive file"}' >&2
  exit 2
fi
```

See `examples/validate-write.sh` and `examples/validate-bash.sh` for complete examples.

### Quote All Variables

```bash
# GOOD: Quoted
echo "$file_path"
cd "$CODEBUDDY_PROJECT_DIR"

# BAD: Unquoted (injection risk)
echo $file_path
cd $CODEBUDDY_PROJECT_DIR
```

### Set Appropriate Timeouts

```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": "bash script.sh",
  "timeout": 10
}
```

**Defaults:** Command hooks (60s), Prompt hooks (30s)

## Performance Considerations

### Parallel Execution

All matching hooks run **in parallel**:

```json
{
  "PreToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Write",
      "hooks": [
        {"type": "command", "command": "check1.sh"},  // Parallel
        {"type": "command", "command": "check2.sh"},  // Parallel
        {"type": "prompt", "prompt": "Validate..."}   // Parallel
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Design implications:**
- Hooks don't see each other's output
- Non-deterministic ordering
- Design for independence

### Optimization

1. Use command hooks for quick deterministic checks
2. Use prompt hooks for complex reasoning
3. Cache validation results in temp files
4. Minimize I/O in hot paths

## Temporarily Active Hooks

Create hooks that activate conditionally by checking for a flag file or configuration:

**Pattern: Flag file activation**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Only active when flag file exists
FLAG_FILE="$CODEBUDDY_PROJECT_DIR/.enable-strict-validation"

if [ ! -f "$FLAG_FILE" ]; then
  # Flag not present, skip validation
  exit 0
fi

# Flag present, run validation
input=$(cat)
# ... validation logic ...
```

**Pattern: Configuration-based activation**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check configuration for activation
CONFIG_FILE="$CODEBUDDY_PROJECT_DIR/.codebuddy/plugin-config.json"

if [ -f "$CONFIG_FILE" ]; then
  enabled=$(jq -r '.strictMode // false' "$CONFIG_FILE")
  if [ "$enabled" != "true" ]; then
    exit 0  # Not enabled, skip
  fi
fi

# Enabled, run hook logic
input=$(cat)
# ... hook logic ...
```

**Use cases:**
- Enable strict validation only when needed
- Temporary debugging hooks
- Project-specific hook behavior
- Feature flags for hooks

**Best practice:** Document activation mechanism in plugin README so users know how to enable/disable temporary hooks.

## Hook Lifecycle and Limitations

### Hooks Load at Session Start

**Important:** Hooks are loaded when CodeBuddy Code session starts. Changes to hook configuration require restarting CodeBuddy Code.

**Cannot hot-swap hooks:**
- Editing `hooks/hooks.json` won't affect current session
- Adding new hook scripts won't be recognized
- Changing hook commands/prompts won't update
- Must restart CodeBuddy Code: exit and run `codebuddy` again

**To test hook changes:**
1. Edit hook configuration or scripts
2. Exit CodeBuddy Code session
3. Restart: `codebuddy` or `cc`
4. New hook configuration loads
5. Test hooks with `codebuddy --debug`

### Hook Validation at Startup

Hooks are validated when CodeBuddy Code starts:
- Invalid JSON in hooks.json causes loading failure
- Missing scripts cause warnings
- Syntax errors reported in debug mode

Use `/hooks` command to review loaded hooks in current session.

## Debugging Hooks

### Enable Debug Mode

```bash
codebuddy --debug
```

Look for hook registration, execution logs, input/output JSON, and timing information.

### Test Hook Scripts

Test command hooks directly:

```bash
echo '{"tool_name": "Write", "tool_input": {"file_path": "/test"}}' | \
  bash ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/validate.sh

echo "Exit code: $?"
```

### Validate JSON Output

Ensure hooks output valid JSON:

```bash
output=$(./your-hook.sh < test-input.json)
echo "$output" | jq .
```

## Quick Reference

### Hook Events Summary

| Event | When | Use For |
|-------|------|---------|
| PreToolUse | Before tool | Validation, modification |
| PostToolUse | After tool | Feedback, logging |
| UserPromptSubmit | User input | Context, validation |
| Stop | Agent stopping | Completeness check |
| SubagentStop | Subagent done | Task validation |
| SessionStart | Session begins | Context loading |
| SessionEnd | Session ends | Cleanup, logging |
| PreCompact | Before compact | Preserve context |
| Notification | User notified | Logging, reactions |

### Best Practices

**DO:**
- ✅ Use prompt-based hooks for complex logic
- ✅ Use ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT} for portability
- ✅ Validate all inputs in command hooks
- ✅ Quote all bash variables
- ✅ Set appropriate timeouts
- ✅ Return structured JSON output
- ✅ Test hooks thoroughly

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Use hardcoded paths
- ❌ Trust user input without validation
- ❌ Create long-running hooks
- ❌ Rely on hook execution order
- ❌ Modify global state unpredictably
- ❌ Log sensitive information

- **`validate-bash.sh`** - Bash command validation example
- **`load-context.sh`** - SessionStart context loading example

### Utility Scripts

Development tools in `scripts/`:

- **`validate-hook-schema.sh`** - Validate hooks.json structure and syntax
- **`test-hook.sh`** - Test hooks with sample input before deployment
- **`hook-linter.sh`** - Check hook scripts for common issues and best practices

### External Resources

- **Examples**: See security-guidance plugin in marketplace
- **Testing**: Use `codebuddy --debug` for detailed logs
- **Validation**: Use `jq` to validate hook JSON output

## Implementation Workflow

To implement hooks in a plugin:

1. Identify events to hook into (PreToolUse, Stop, SessionStart, etc.)
2. Decide between prompt-based (flexible) or command (deterministic) hooks
3. Write hook configuration in `hooks/hooks.json`
4. For command hooks, create hook scripts
5. Use ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT} for all file references
6. Validate configuration with `scripts/validate-hook-schema.sh hooks/hooks.json`
7. Test hooks with `scripts/test-hook.sh` before deployment
8. Test in CodeBuddy Code with `codebuddy --debug`
9. Document hooks in plugin README

Focus on prompt-based hooks for most use cases. Reserve command hooks for performance-critical or deterministic checks.

# MCP Integration for CodeBuddy Code Plugins

## Overview

Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables CodeBuddy Code plugins to integrate with external services and APIs by providing structured tool access. Use MCP integration to expose external service capabilities as tools within CodeBuddy Code.

**Key capabilities:**
- Connect to external services (databases, APIs, file systems)
- Provide 10+ related tools from a single service
- Handle OAuth and complex authentication flows
- Bundle MCP servers with plugins for automatic setup

## MCP Server Configuration Methods

Plugins can bundle MCP servers in two ways:

### Method 1: Dedicated .mcp.json (Recommended)

Create `.mcp.json` at plugin root:

```json
{
  "database-tools": {
    "command": "${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/servers/db-server",
    "args": ["--config", "${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config.json"],
    "env": {
      "DB_URL": "${DB_URL}"
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to maintain
- Better for multiple servers

### Method 2: Inline in plugin.json

Add `mcpServers` field to plugin.json:

```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "mcpServers": {
    "plugin-api": {
      "command": "${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/servers/api-server",
      "args": ["--port", "8080"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Single configuration file
- Good for simple single-server plugins

## MCP Server Types

### stdio (Local Process)

Execute local MCP servers as child processes. Best for local tools and custom servers.

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "filesystem": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/allowed/path"],
    "env": {
      "LOG_LEVEL": "debug"
    }
  }
}
```

**Use cases:**
- File system access
- Local database connections
- Custom MCP servers
- NPM-packaged MCP servers

**Process management:**
- CodeBuddy Code spawns and manages the process
- Communicates via stdin/stdout
- Terminates when CodeBuddy Code exits

### SSE (Server-Sent Events)

Connect to hosted MCP servers with OAuth support. Best for cloud services.

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "asana": {
    "type": "sse",
    "url": "https://mcp.asana.com/sse"
  }
}
```

**Use cases:**
- Official hosted MCP servers (Asana, GitHub, etc.)
- Cloud services with MCP endpoints
- OAuth-based authentication
- No local installation needed

**Authentication:**
- OAuth flows handled automatically
- User prompted on first use
- Tokens managed by CodeBuddy Code

### HTTP (REST API)

Connect to RESTful MCP servers with token authentication.

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "api-service": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer ${API_TOKEN}",
      "X-Custom-Header": "value"
    }
  }
}
```

**Use cases:**
- REST API-based MCP servers
- Token-based authentication
- Custom API backends
- Stateless interactions

### WebSocket (Real-time)

Connect to WebSocket MCP servers for real-time bidirectional communication.

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "realtime-service": {
    "type": "ws",
    "url": "wss://mcp.example.com/ws",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer ${TOKEN}"
    }
  }
}
```

**Use cases:**
- Real-time data streaming
- Persistent connections
- Push notifications from server
- Low-latency requirements

## Environment Variable Expansion

All MCP configurations support environment variable substitution:

**${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}** - Plugin directory (always use for portability):
```json
{
  "command": "${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/servers/my-server"
}
```

**User environment variables** - From user's shell:
```json
{
  "env": {
    "API_KEY": "${MY_API_KEY}",
    "DATABASE_URL": "${DB_URL}"
  }
}
```

**Best practice:** Document all required environment variables in plugin README.

## MCP Tool Naming

When MCP servers provide tools, they're automatically prefixed:

**Format:** `mcp__plugin_<plugin-name>_<server-name>__<tool-name>`

**Example:**
- Plugin: `asana`
- Server: `asana`
- Tool: `create_task`
- **Full name:** `mcp__plugin_asana_asana__asana_create_task`

### Using MCP Tools in Commands

Pre-allow specific MCP tools in command frontmatter:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: [
  "mcp__plugin_asana_asana__asana_create_task",
  "mcp__plugin_asana_asana__asana_search_tasks"
]
---
```

**Wildcard (use sparingly):**
```markdown
---
allowed-tools: ["mcp__plugin_asana_asana__*"]
---
```

**Best practice:** Pre-allow specific tools, not wildcards, for security.

## Lifecycle Management

**Automatic startup:**
- MCP servers start when plugin enables
- Connection established before first tool use
- Restart required for configuration changes

**Lifecycle:**
1. Plugin loads
2. MCP configuration parsed
3. Server process started (stdio) or connection established (SSE/HTTP/WS)
4. Tools discovered and registered
5. Tools available as `mcp__plugin_...__...`

**Viewing servers:**
Use `/mcp` command to see all servers including plugin-provided ones.

## Authentication Patterns

### OAuth (SSE/HTTP)

OAuth handled automatically by CodeBuddy Code:

```json
{
  "type": "sse",
  "url": "https://mcp.example.com/sse"
}
```

User authenticates in browser on first use. No additional configuration needed.

### Token-Based (Headers)

Static or environment variable tokens:

```json
{
  "type": "http",
  "url": "https://api.example.com",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer ${API_TOKEN}"
  }
}
```

Document required environment variables in README.

### Environment Variables (stdio)

Pass configuration to MCP server:

```json
{
  "command": "python",
  "args": ["-m", "my_mcp_server"],
  "env": {
    "DATABASE_URL": "${DB_URL}",
    "API_KEY": "${API_KEY}",
    "LOG_LEVEL": "info"
  }
}
```

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Tool Wrapper

Commands use MCP tools with user interaction:

```markdown
# Command: create-item.md
---
allowed-tools: ["mcp__plugin_name_server__create_item"]
---

Steps:
1. Gather item details from user
2. Use mcp__plugin_name_server__create_item
3. Confirm creation
```

**Use for:** Adding validation or preprocessing before MCP calls.

### Pattern 2: Autonomous Agent

Agents use MCP tools autonomously:

```markdown
# Agent: data-analyzer.md

Analysis Process:
1. Query data via mcp__plugin_db_server__query
2. Process and analyze results
3. Generate insights report
```

**Use for:** Multi-step MCP workflows without user interaction.

### Pattern 3: Multi-Server Plugin

Integrate multiple MCP servers:

```json
{
  "github": {
    "type": "sse",
    "url": "https://mcp.github.com/sse"
  },
  "jira": {
    "type": "sse",
    "url": "https://mcp.jira.com/sse"
  }
}
```

**Use for:** Workflows spanning multiple services.

## Security Best Practices

### Use HTTPS/WSS

Always use secure connections:

```json
✅ "url": "https://mcp.example.com/sse"
❌ "url": "http://mcp.example.com/sse"
```

### Token Management

**DO:**
- ✅ Use environment variables for tokens
- ✅ Document required env vars in README
- ✅ Let OAuth flow handle authentication

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Hardcode tokens in configuration
- ❌ Commit tokens to git
- ❌ Share tokens in documentation

### Permission Scoping

Pre-allow only necessary MCP tools:

```markdown
✅ allowed-tools: [
  "mcp__plugin_api_server__read_data",
  "mcp__plugin_api_server__create_item"
]

❌ allowed-tools: ["mcp__plugin_api_server__*"]
```

## Error Handling

### Connection Failures

Handle MCP server unavailability:
- Provide fallback behavior in commands
- Inform user of connection issues
- Check server URL and configuration

### Tool Call Errors

Handle failed MCP operations:
- Validate inputs before calling MCP tools
- Provide clear error messages
- Check rate limiting and quotas

### Configuration Errors

Validate MCP configuration:
- Test server connectivity during development
- Validate JSON syntax
- Check required environment variables

## Performance Considerations

### Lazy Loading

MCP servers connect on-demand:
- Not all servers connect at startup
- First tool use triggers connection
- Connection pooling managed automatically

### Batching

Batch similar requests when possible:

```
# Good: Single query with filters
tasks = search_tasks(project="X", assignee="me", limit=50)

# Avoid: Many individual queries
for id in task_ids:
    task = get_task(id)
```

## Testing MCP Integration

### Local Testing

1. Configure MCP server in `.mcp.json`
2. Install plugin locally (`.codebuddy-plugin/`)
3. Run `/mcp` to verify server appears
4. Test tool calls in commands
5. Check `codebuddy --debug` logs for connection issues

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] MCP configuration is valid JSON
- [ ] Server URL is correct and accessible
- [ ] Required environment variables documented
- [ ] Tools appear in `/mcp` output
- [ ] Authentication works (OAuth or tokens)
- [ ] Tool calls succeed from commands
- [ ] Error cases handled gracefully

## Debugging

### Enable Debug Logging

```bash
codebuddy --debug
```

Look for:
- MCP server connection attempts
- Tool discovery logs
- Authentication flows
- Tool call errors

### Common Issues

**Server not connecting:**
- Check URL is correct
- Verify server is running (stdio)
- Check network connectivity
- Review authentication configuration

**Tools not available:**
- Verify server connected successfully
- Check tool names match exactly
- Run `/mcp` to see available tools
- Restart CodeBuddy Code after config changes

**Authentication failing:**
- Clear cached auth tokens
- Re-authenticate
- Check token scopes and permissions
- Verify environment variables set

## Quick Reference

### MCP Server Types

| Type | Transport | Best For | Auth |
|------|-----------|----------|------|
| stdio | Process | Local tools, custom servers | Env vars |
| SSE | HTTP | Hosted services, cloud APIs | OAuth |
| HTTP | REST | API backends, token auth | Tokens |
| ws | WebSocket | Real-time, streaming | Tokens |

### Configuration Checklist

- [ ] Server type specified (stdio/SSE/HTTP/ws)
- [ ] Type-specific fields complete (command or url)
- [ ] Authentication configured
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] HTTPS/WSS used (not HTTP/WS)
- [ ] ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT} used for paths

### Best Practices

- ✅ Test MCP integration before publishing
- ✅ Handle connection and tool errors gracefully

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Hardcode absolute paths
- ❌ Commit credentials to git
- ❌ Use HTTP instead of HTTPS
- ❌ Pre-allow all tools with wildcards
- ❌ Skip error handling
- ❌ Forget to document setup

# Plugin Settings Pattern for CodeBuddy Code Plugins

## Overview

Plugins can store user-configurable settings and state in `.codebuddy/plugin-name.local.md` files within the project directory. This pattern uses YAML frontmatter for structured configuration and markdown content for prompts or additional context.

**Key characteristics:**
- File location: `.codebuddy/plugin-name.local.md` in project root
- Structure: YAML frontmatter + markdown body
- Purpose: Per-project plugin configuration and state
- Usage: Read from hooks, commands, and agents
- Lifecycle: User-managed (not in git, should be in `.gitignore`)

## File Structure

### Basic Template

```markdown
---
enabled: true
setting1: value1
setting2: value2
numeric_setting: 42
list_setting: ["item1", "item2"]
---

# Additional Context

This markdown body can contain:
- Task descriptions
- Additional instructions
- Prompts to feed back to CodeBuddy
- Documentation or notes
```

### Example: Plugin State File

**.codebuddy/my-plugin.local.md:**
```markdown
---
enabled: true
strict_mode: false
max_retries: 3
notification_level: info
coordinator_session: team-leader
---

# Plugin Configuration

This plugin is configured for standard validation mode.
Contact @team-lead with questions.
```

## Reading Settings Files

### From Hooks (Bash Scripts)

**Pattern: Check existence and parse frontmatter**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Define state file path
STATE_FILE=".codebuddy/my-plugin.local.md"

# Quick exit if file doesn't exist
if [[ ! -f "$STATE_FILE" ]]; then
  exit 0  # Plugin not configured, skip
fi

# Parse YAML frontmatter (between --- markers)
FRONTMATTER=$(sed -n '/^---$/,/^---$/{ /^---$/d; p; }' "$STATE_FILE")

# Extract individual fields
ENABLED=$(echo "$FRONTMATTER" | grep '^enabled:' | sed 's/enabled: *//' | sed 's/^"\(.*\)"$/\1/')
STRICT_MODE=$(echo "$FRONTMATTER" | grep '^strict_mode:' | sed 's/strict_mode: *//' | sed 's/^"\(.*\)"$/\1/')

# Check if enabled
if [[ "$ENABLED" != "true" ]]; then
  exit 0  # Disabled
fi

# Use configuration in hook logic
if [[ "$STRICT_MODE" == "true" ]]; then
  # Apply strict validation
  # ...
fi
```

See `examples/read-settings-hook.sh` for complete working example.

### From Commands

Commands can read settings files to customize behavior:

```markdown
---
description: Process data with plugin
allowed-tools: ["Read", "Bash"]
---

# Process Command

Steps:
1. Check if settings exist at `.codebuddy/my-plugin.local.md`
2. Read configuration using Read tool
3. Parse YAML frontmatter to extract settings
4. Apply settings to processing logic
5. Execute with configured behavior
```

### From Agents

Agents can reference settings in their instructions:

```markdown
---
name: configured-agent
description: Agent that adapts to project settings
---

Check for plugin settings at `.codebuddy/my-plugin.local.md`.
If present, parse YAML frontmatter and adapt behavior according to:
- enabled: Whether plugin is active
- mode: Processing mode (strict, standard, lenient)
- Additional configuration fields
```

## Parsing Techniques

### Extract Frontmatter

```bash
# Extract everything between --- markers
FRONTMATTER=$(sed -n '/^---$/,/^---$/{ /^---$/d; p; }' "$FILE")
```

### Read Individual Fields

**String fields:**
```bash
VALUE=$(echo "$FRONTMATTER" | grep '^field_name:' | sed 's/field_name: *//' | sed 's/^"\(.*\)"$/\1/')
```

**Boolean fields:**
```bash
ENABLED=$(echo "$FRONTMATTER" | grep '^enabled:' | sed 's/enabled: *//')
# Compare: if [[ "$ENABLED" == "true" ]]; then
```

**Numeric fields:**
```bash
MAX=$(echo "$FRONTMATTER" | grep '^max_value:' | sed 's/max_value: *//')
# Use: if [[ $MAX -gt 100 ]]; then
```

### Read Markdown Body

Extract content after second `---`:

```bash
# Get everything after closing ---
BODY=$(awk '/^---$/{i++; next} i>=2' "$FILE")
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Temporarily Active Hooks

Use settings file to control hook activation:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
STATE_FILE=".codebuddy/security-scan.local.md"

# Quick exit if not configured
if [[ ! -f "$STATE_FILE" ]]; then
  exit 0
fi

# Read enabled flag
FRONTMATTER=$(sed -n '/^---$/,/^---$/{ /^---$/d; p; }' "$STATE_FILE")
ENABLED=$(echo "$FRONTMATTER" | grep '^enabled:' | sed 's/enabled: *//')

if [[ "$ENABLED" != "true" ]]; then
  exit 0  # Disabled
fi

# Run hook logic
# ...
```

**Use case:** Enable/disable hooks without editing hooks.json (requires restart).

### Pattern 2: Agent State Management

Store agent-specific state and configuration:

**.codebuddy/multi-agent-swarm.local.md:**
```markdown
---
agent_name: auth-agent
task_number: 3.5
pr_number: 1234
coordinator_session: team-leader
enabled: true
dependencies: ["Task 3.4"]
---

# Task Assignment

Implement JWT authentication for the API.

**Success Criteria:**
- Authentication endpoints created
- Tests passing
- PR created and CI green
```

Read from hooks to coordinate agents:

```bash
AGENT_NAME=$(echo "$FRONTMATTER" | grep '^agent_name:' | sed 's/agent_name: *//')
COORDINATOR=$(echo "$FRONTMATTER" | grep '^coordinator_session:' | sed 's/coordinator_session: *//')

# Send notification to coordinator
tmux send-keys -t "$COORDINATOR" "Agent $AGENT_NAME completed task" Enter
```

### Pattern 3: Configuration-Driven Behavior

**.codebuddy/my-plugin.local.md:**
```markdown
---
validation_level: strict
max_file_size: 1000000
allowed_extensions: [".js", ".ts", ".tsx"]
enable_logging: true
---

# Validation Configuration

Strict mode enabled for this project.
All writes validated against security policies.
```

Use in hooks or commands:

```bash
LEVEL=$(echo "$FRONTMATTER" | grep '^validation_level:' | sed 's/validation_level: *//')

case "$LEVEL" in
  strict)
    # Apply strict validation
    ;;
  standard)
    # Apply standard validation
    ;;
  lenient)
    # Apply lenient validation
    ;;
esac
```

## Creating Settings Files

### From Commands

Commands can create settings files:

```markdown
# Setup Command

Steps:
1. Ask user for configuration preferences
2. Create `.codebuddy/my-plugin.local.md` with YAML frontmatter
3. Set appropriate values based on user input
4. Inform user that settings are saved
5. Remind user to restart CodeBuddy Code for hooks to recognize changes
```

### Template Generation

Provide template in plugin README:

```markdown
## Configuration

Create `.codebuddy/my-plugin.local.md` in your project:

\`\`\`markdown
---
enabled: true
mode: standard
max_retries: 3
---

# Plugin Configuration

Your settings are active.
\`\`\`

After creating or editing, restart CodeBuddy Code for changes to take effect.
```

## Best Practices

### File Naming

✅ **DO:**
- Use `.codebuddy/plugin-name.local.md` format
- Match plugin name exactly
- Use `.local.md` suffix for user-local files

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use different directory (not `.codebuddy/`)
- Use inconsistent naming
- Use `.md` without `.local` (might be committed)

### Gitignore

Always add to `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
.codebuddy/*.local.md
.codebuddy/*.local.json
```

Document this in plugin README.

### Defaults

Provide sensible defaults when settings file doesn't exist:

```bash
if [[ ! -f "$STATE_FILE" ]]; then
  # Use defaults
  ENABLED=true
  MODE=standard
else
  # Read from file
  # ...
fi
```

### Validation

Validate settings values:

```bash
MAX=$(echo "$FRONTMATTER" | grep '^max_value:' | sed 's/max_value: *//')

# Validate numeric range
if ! [[ "$MAX" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] || [[ $MAX -lt 1 ]] || [[ $MAX -gt 100 ]]; then
  echo "⚠️  Invalid max_value in settings (must be 1-100)" >&2
  MAX=10  # Use default
fi
```

### Restart Requirement

**Important:** Settings changes require CodeBuddy Code restart.

Document in your README:

```markdown
## Changing Settings

After editing `.codebuddy/my-plugin.local.md`:
1. Save the file
2. Exit CodeBuddy Code
3. Restart: `codebuddy` or `cc`
4. New settings will be loaded
```

Hooks cannot be hot-swapped within a session.

## Security Considerations

### Sanitize User Input

When writing settings files from user input:

```bash
# Escape quotes in user input
SAFE_VALUE=$(echo "$USER_INPUT" | sed 's/"/\\"/g')

# Write to file
cat > "$STATE_FILE" <<EOF
---
user_setting: "$SAFE_VALUE"
---
EOF
```

### Validate File Paths

If settings contain file paths:

```bash
FILE_PATH=$(echo "$FRONTMATTER" | grep '^data_file:' | sed 's/data_file: *//')

# Check for path traversal
if [[ "$FILE_PATH" == *".."* ]]; then
  echo "⚠️  Invalid path in settings (path traversal)" >&2
  exit 2
fi
```

### Permissions

Settings files should be:
- Readable by user only (`chmod 600`)
- Not committed to git
- Not shared between users

## Real-World Examples

### multi-agent-swarm Plugin

**.codebuddy/multi-agent-swarm.local.md:**
```markdown
---
agent_name: auth-implementation
task_number: 3.5
pr_number: 1234
coordinator_session: team-leader
enabled: true
dependencies: ["Task 3.4"]
additional_instructions: Use JWT tokens, not sessions
---

# Task: Implement Authentication

Build JWT-based authentication for the REST API.
Coordinate with auth-agent on shared types.
```

**Hook usage (agent-stop-notification.sh):**
- Checks if file exists (line 15-18: quick exit if not)
- Parses frontmatter to get coordinator_session, agent_name, enabled
- Sends notifications to coordinator if enabled
- Allows quick activation/deactivation via `enabled: true/false`

### ralph-loop Plugin

**.codebuddy/ralph-loop.local.md:**
```markdown
---
iteration: 1
max_iterations: 10
completion_promise: "All tests passing and build successful"
---

Fix all the linting errors in the project.
Make sure tests pass after each fix.
```

**Hook usage (stop-hook.sh):**
- Checks if file exists (line 15-18: quick exit if not active)
- Reads iteration count and max_iterations
- Extracts completion_promise for loop termination
- Reads body as the prompt to feed back
- Updates iteration count on each loop

## Quick Reference

### File Location

```
project-root/
└── .codebuddy/
    └── plugin-name.local.md
```

### Frontmatter Parsing

```bash
# Extract frontmatter
FRONTMATTER=$(sed -n '/^---$/,/^---$/{ /^---$/d; p; }' "$FILE")

# Read field
VALUE=$(echo "$FRONTMATTER" | grep '^field:' | sed 's/field: *//' | sed 's/^"\(.*\)"$/\1/')
```

### Body Parsing

```bash
# Extract body (after second ---)
BODY=$(awk '/^---$/{i++; next} i>=2' "$FILE")
```

### Quick Exit Pattern

```bash
if [[ ! -f ".codebuddy/my-plugin.local.md" ]]; then
  exit 0  # Not configured
fi
```

- **`references/real-world-examples.md`** - Deep dive into multi-agent-swarm and ralph-loop implementations

### Example Files

Working examples in `examples/`:

- **`read-settings-hook.sh`** - Hook that reads and uses settings
- **`create-settings-command.md`** - Command that creates settings file
- **`example-settings.md`** - Template settings file

### Utility Scripts

Development tools in `scripts/`:

- **`validate-settings.sh`** - Validate settings file structure
- **`parse-frontmatter.sh`** - Extract frontmatter fields

## Implementation Workflow

To add settings to a plugin:

1. Design settings schema (which fields, types, defaults)
2. Create template file in plugin documentation
3. Add gitignore entry for `.codebuddy/*.local.md`
4. Implement settings parsing in hooks/commands
5. Use quick-exit pattern (check file exists, check enabled field)
6. Document settings in plugin README with template
7. Remind users that changes require CodeBuddy Code restart

Focus on keeping settings simple and providing good defaults when settings file doesn't exist.

## 模块：plugin-structure

# Plugin Structure for CodeBuddy Code

## Overview

CodeBuddy Code plugins follow a standardized directory structure with automatic component discovery. Understanding this structure enables creating well-organized, maintainable plugins that integrate seamlessly with CodeBuddy Code.

**Key concepts:**
- Conventional directory layout for automatic discovery
- Manifest-driven configuration in `.codebuddy-plugin/plugin.json`
- Component-based organization (commands, agents, skills, hooks)
- Portable path references using `${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}`
- Explicit vs. auto-discovered component loading

## Directory Structure

Every CodeBuddy Code plugin follows this organizational pattern:

```
plugin-name/
├── .codebuddy-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # Required: Plugin manifest
├── commands/                 # Slash commands (.md files)
├── agents/                   # Subagent definitions (.md files)
├── skills/                   # Agent skills (subdirectories)
│   └── skill-name/
│       └── SKILL.md         # Required for each skill
├── hooks/
│   └── hooks.json           # Event handler configuration
├── .mcp.json                # MCP server definitions
└── scripts/                 # Helper scripts and utilities
```

**Critical rules:**

1. **Manifest location**: The `plugin.json` manifest MUST be in `.codebuddy-plugin/` directory
2. **Component locations**: All component directories (commands, agents, skills, hooks) MUST be at plugin root level, NOT nested inside `.codebuddy-plugin/`
3. **Optional components**: Only create directories for components the plugin actually uses
4. **Naming convention**: Use kebab-case for all directory and file names

## Plugin Manifest (plugin.json)

The manifest defines plugin metadata and configuration. Located at `.codebuddy-plugin/plugin.json`:

### Required Fields

```json
{
  "name": "plugin-name"
}
```

**Name requirements:**
- Use kebab-case format (lowercase with hyphens)
- Must be unique across installed plugins
- No spaces or special characters
- Example: `code-review-assistant`, `test-runner`, `api-docs`

### Recommended Metadata

```json
{
  "name": "plugin-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Brief explanation of plugin purpose",
  "author": {
    "name": "Author Name",
    "email": "author@example.com",
    "url": "https://example.com"
  },
  "homepage": "https://docs.example.com",
  "repository": "https://github.com/user/plugin-name",
  "license": "MIT",
  "keywords": ["testing", "automation", "ci-cd"]
}
```

**Version format**: Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
**Keywords**: Use for plugin discovery and categorization

### Component Path Configuration

Specify custom paths for components (supplements default directories):

```json
{
  "name": "plugin-name",
  "commands": "./custom-commands",
  "agents": ["./agents", "./specialized-agents"],
  "hooks": "./config/hooks.json",
  "mcpServers": "./.mcp.json"
}
```

**Important**: Custom paths supplement defaults—they don't replace them. Components in both default directories and custom paths will load.

**Path rules:**
- Must be relative to plugin root
- Must start with `./`
- Cannot use absolute paths
- Support arrays for multiple locations

## Component Organization

### Commands

**Location**: `commands/` directory
**Format**: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
**Auto-discovery**: All `.md` files in `commands/` load automatically

**Example structure**:
```
commands/
├── review.md        # /review command
├── test.md          # /test command
└── deploy.md        # /deploy command
```

**File format**:
```markdown
---
name: command-name
description: Command description
---

Command implementation instructions...
```

**Usage**: Commands integrate as native slash commands in CodeBuddy Code

### Agents

**Location**: `agents/` directory
**Format**: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
**Auto-discovery**: All `.md` files in `agents/` load automatically

**Example structure**:
```
agents/
├── code-reviewer.md
├── test-generator.md
└── refactorer.md
```

**File format**:
```markdown
---
description: Agent role and expertise
capabilities:
  - Specific task 1
  - Specific task 2
---

Detailed agent instructions and knowledge...
```

**Usage**: Users can invoke agents manually, or CodeBuddy Code selects them automatically based on task context

### Skills

**Location**: `skills/` directory with subdirectories per skill
**Format**: Each skill in its own directory with `SKILL.md` file
**Auto-discovery**: All `SKILL.md` files in skill subdirectories load automatically

**Example structure**:
```
skills/
├── api-testing/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   ├── scripts/
│   │   └── test-runner.py
│   └── references/
│       └── api-spec.md
└── database-migrations/
    ├── SKILL.md
    └── examples/
        └── migration-template.sql
```

**SKILL.md format**:
```markdown
---
name: Skill Name
description: When to use this skill
version: 1.0.0
---

Skill instructions and guidance...
```

**Supporting files**: Skills can include scripts, references, examples, or assets in subdirectories

**Usage**: CodeBuddy Code autonomously activates skills based on task context matching the description

### Hooks

**Location**: `hooks/hooks.json` or inline in `plugin.json`
**Format**: JSON configuration defining event handlers
**Registration**: Hooks register automatically when plugin enables

**Example structure**:
```
hooks/
├── hooks.json           # Hook configuration
└── scripts/
    ├── validate.sh      # Hook script
    └── check-style.sh   # Hook script
```

**Configuration format**:
```json
{
  "PreToolUse": [{
    "matcher": "Write|Edit",
    "hooks": [{
      "type": "command",
      "command": "bash ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/scripts/validate.sh",
      "timeout": 30
    }]
  }]
}
```

**Available events**: PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop, SubagentStop, SessionStart, SessionEnd, UserPromptSubmit, PreCompact, Notification

**Usage**: Hooks execute automatically in response to CodeBuddy Code events

### MCP Servers

**Location**: `.mcp.json` at plugin root or inline in `plugin.json`
**Format**: JSON configuration for MCP server definitions
**Auto-start**: Servers start automatically when plugin enables

**Example format**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/servers/server.js"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "${API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Usage**: MCP servers integrate seamlessly with CodeBuddy Code's tool system

## Portable Path References

### ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}

Use `${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}` environment variable for all intra-plugin path references:

```json
{
  "command": "bash ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run.sh"
}
```

**Why it matters**: Plugins install in different locations depending on:
- User installation method (marketplace, local, npm)
- Operating system conventions
- User preferences

**Where to use it**:
- Hook command paths
- MCP server command arguments
- Script execution references
- Resource file paths

**Never use**:
- Hardcoded absolute paths (`/Users/name/plugins/...`)
- Relative paths from working directory (`./scripts/...` in commands)
- Home directory shortcuts (`~/plugins/...`)

### Path Resolution Rules

**In manifest JSON fields** (hooks, MCP servers):
```json
"command": "${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/tool.sh"
```

**In component files** (commands, agents, skills):
```markdown
Reference scripts at: ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/helper.py
```

**In executed scripts**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT} available as environment variable
source "${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/common.sh"
```

## File Naming Conventions

### Component Files

**Commands**: Use kebab-case `.md` files
- `code-review.md` → `/code-review`
- `run-tests.md` → `/run-tests`
- `api-docs.md` → `/api-docs`

**Agents**: Use kebab-case `.md` files describing role
- `test-generator.md`
- `code-reviewer.md`
- `performance-analyzer.md`

**Skills**: Use kebab-case directory names
- `api-testing/`
- `database-migrations/`
- `error-handling/`

### Supporting Files

**Scripts**: Use descriptive kebab-case names with appropriate extensions
- `validate-input.sh`
- `generate-report.py`
- `process-data.js`

**Documentation**: Use kebab-case markdown files
- `api-reference.md`
- `migration-guide.md`
- `best-practices.md`

**Configuration**: Use standard names
- `hooks.json`
- `.mcp.json`
- `plugin.json`

## Auto-Discovery Mechanism

CodeBuddy Code automatically discovers and loads components:

1. **Plugin manifest**: Reads `.codebuddy-plugin/plugin.json` when plugin enables
2. **Commands**: Scans `commands/` directory for `.md` files
3. **Agents**: Scans `agents/` directory for `.md` files
4. **Skills**: Scans `skills/` for subdirectories containing `SKILL.md`
5. **Hooks**: Loads configuration from `hooks/hooks.json` or manifest
6. **MCP servers**: Loads configuration from `.mcp.json` or manifest

**Discovery timing**:
- Plugin installation: Components register with CodeBuddy Code
- Plugin enable: Components become available for use
- No restart required: Changes take effect on next CodeBuddy Code session

**Override behavior**: Custom paths in `plugin.json` supplement (not replace) default directories

## Best Practices

### Organization

1. **Logical grouping**: Group related components together
   - Put test-related commands, agents, and skills together
   - Create subdirectories in `scripts/` for different purposes

2. **Minimal manifest**: Keep `plugin.json` lean
   - Only specify custom paths when necessary
   - Rely on auto-discovery for standard layouts
   - Use inline configuration only for simple cases

3. **Documentation**: Include README files
   - Plugin root: Overall purpose and usage
   - Component directories: Specific guidance
   - Script directories: Usage and requirements

### Naming

1. **Consistency**: Use consistent naming across components
   - If command is `test-runner`, name related agent `test-runner-agent`
   - Match skill directory names to their purpose

2. **Clarity**: Use descriptive names that indicate purpose
   - Good: `api-integration-testing/`, `code-quality-checker.md`
   - Avoid: `utils/`, `misc.md`, `temp.sh`

3. **Length**: Balance brevity with clarity
   - Commands: 2-3 words (`review-pr`, `run-ci`)
   - Agents: Describe role clearly (`code-reviewer`, `test-generator`)
   - Skills: Topic-focused (`error-handling`, `api-design`)

### Portability

1. **Always use ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}**: Never hardcode paths
2. **Test on multiple systems**: Verify on macOS, Linux, Windows
3. **Document dependencies**: List required tools and versions
4. **Avoid system-specific features**: Use portable bash/Python constructs

### Maintenance

1. **Version consistently**: Update version in plugin.json for releases
2. **Deprecate gracefully**: Mark old components clearly before removal
3. **Document breaking changes**: Note changes affecting existing users
4. **Test thoroughly**: Verify all components work after changes

## Common Patterns

### Minimal Plugin

Single command with no dependencies:
```
my-plugin/
├── .codebuddy-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json    # Just name field
└── commands/
    └── hello.md       # Single command
```

### Full-Featured Plugin

Complete plugin with all component types:
```
my-plugin/
├── .codebuddy-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json
├── commands/          # User-facing commands
├── agents/            # Specialized subagents
├── skills/            # Auto-activating skills
├── hooks/             # Event handlers
│   ├── hooks.json
│   └── scripts/
├── .mcp.json          # External integrations
└── scripts/           # Shared utilities
```

### Skill-Focused Plugin

Plugin providing only skills:
```
my-plugin/
├── .codebuddy-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json
└── skills/
    ├── skill-one/
    │   └── SKILL.md
    └── skill-two/
        └── SKILL.md
```

## Troubleshooting

**Component not loading**:
- Verify file is in correct directory with correct extension
- Check YAML frontmatter syntax (commands, agents, skills)
- Ensure skill has `SKILL.md` (not `README.md` or other name)
- Confirm plugin is enabled in CodeBuddy Code settings

**Path resolution errors**:
- Replace all hardcoded paths with `${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT}`
- Verify paths are relative and start with `./` in manifest
- Check that referenced files exist at specified paths
- Test with `echo $CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT` in hook scripts

**Auto-discovery not working**:
- Confirm directories are at plugin root (not in `.codebuddy-plugin/`)
- Check file naming follows conventions (kebab-case, correct extensions)
- Verify custom paths in manifest are correct
- Restart CodeBuddy Code to reload plugin configuration

**Conflicts between plugins**:
- Use unique, descriptive component names
- Namespace commands with plugin name if needed
- Document potential conflicts in plugin README
- Consider command prefixes for related functionality

# Skill Development for CodeBuddy Code Plugins

This skill provides guidance for creating effective skills for CodeBuddy Code plugins.

## About Skills

Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend CodeBuddy's capabilities by providing
specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as "onboarding guides" for specific
domains or tasks—they transform CodeBuddy from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent
equipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.

### What Skills Provide

1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains
2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs
3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic
4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks

### Anatomy of a Skill

Every skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)
│   │   ├── name: (required)
│   │   └── description: (required)
│   └── Markdown instructions (required)
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)
    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)
```

#### SKILL.md (required)

**Metadata Quality:** The `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter determine when CodeBuddy will use the skill. Be specific about what the skill does and when to use it. Use the third-person (e.g. "This skill should be used when..." instead of "Use this skill when...").

#### Bundled Resources (optional)

##### Scripts (`scripts/`)

Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.

- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed
- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks
- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context
- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by CodeBuddy for patching or environment-specific adjustments

##### References (`references/`)

Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform CodeBuddy's process and thinking.

- **When to include**: For documentation that CodeBuddy should reference while working
- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications
- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides
- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when CodeBuddy determines it's needed
- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md
- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.

##### Assets (`assets/`)

Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output CodeBuddy produces.

- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output
- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography
- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified
- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables CodeBuddy to use files without loading them into context

### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle

Skills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:

1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)
3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by CodeBuddy (Unlimited*)

*Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window.

## Skill Creation Process

To create a skill, follow the "Skill Creation Process" in order, skipping steps only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.

### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples

Skip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.

To create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.

For example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:

- "What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?"
- "Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?"
- "I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?"
- "What would a user say that should trigger this skill?"

To avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.

Conclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.

### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents

To turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:

1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch
2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly

Example: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like "Help me rotate this PDF," the analysis shows:

1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time
2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill

Example: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like "Build me a todo app" or "Build me a dashboard to track my steps," the analysis shows:

1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time
2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill

Example: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like "How many users have logged in today?" the analysis shows:

1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time
2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill

**For CodeBuddy Code plugins:** When building a hooks skill, the analysis shows:
1. Developers repeatedly need to validate hooks.json and test hook scripts
2. `scripts/validate-hook-schema.sh` and `scripts/test-hook.sh` utilities would be helpful
3. `references/patterns.md` for detailed hook patterns to avoid bloating SKILL.md

To establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.

### Step 3: Create Skill Structure

For CodeBuddy Code plugins, create the skill directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p plugin-name/skills/skill-name/{references,examples,scripts}
touch plugin-name/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md
```

**Note:** Unlike the generic skill-creator which uses `init_skill.py`, plugin skills are created directly in the plugin's `skills/` directory with a simpler manual structure.

### Step 4: Edit the Skill

When editing the (newly-created or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of CodeBuddy to use. Focus on including information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to CodeBuddy. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another CodeBuddy instance execute these tasks more effectively.

#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents

To begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.

Also, delete any example files and directories not needed for the skill. Create only the directories you actually need (references/, examples/, scripts/).

#### Update SKILL.md

**Writing Style:** Write the entire skill using **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person. Use objective, instructional language (e.g., "To accomplish X, do Y" rather than "You should do X" or "If you need to do X"). This maintains consistency and clarity for AI consumption.

**Description (Frontmatter):** Use third-person format with specific trigger phrases:

```yaml
---
name: Skill Name
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "specific phrase 1", "specific phrase 2", "specific phrase 3". Include exact phrases users would say that should trigger this skill. Be concrete and specific.
version: 0.1.0
---
```

**Good description examples:**
```yaml
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "create a hook", "add a PreToolUse hook", "validate tool use", "implement prompt-based hooks", or mentions hook events (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop).
```

**Bad description examples:**
```yaml
description: Use this skill when working with hooks.  # Wrong person, vague
description: Load when user needs hook help.  # Not third person
description: Provides hook guidance.  # No trigger phrases
```

To complete SKILL.md body, answer the following questions:

1. What is the purpose of the skill, in a few sentences?
2. When should the skill be used? (Include this in frontmatter description with specific triggers)
3. In practice, how should CodeBuddy use the skill? All reusable skill contents developed above should be referenced so that CodeBuddy knows how to use them.

**Keep SKILL.md lean:** Target 1,500-2,000 words for the body. Move detailed content to references/:
- Detailed patterns → `references/patterns.md`
- Advanced techniques → `references/advanced.md`
- Migration guides → `references/migration.md`
- API references → `references/api-reference.md`

**Reference resources in SKILL.md:**
```markdown

- **`references/patterns.md`** - Common patterns
- **`references/advanced.md`** - Advanced use cases

### Example Files

Working examples in `examples/`:
- **`example-script.sh`** - Working example
```

### Step 5: Validate and Test

**For plugin skills, validation is different from generic skills:**

1. **Check structure**: Skill directory in `plugin-name/skills/skill-name/`
2. **Validate SKILL.md**: Has frontmatter with name and description
3. **Check trigger phrases**: Description includes specific user queries
4. **Verify writing style**: Body uses imperative/infinitive form, not second person
5. **Test progressive disclosure**: SKILL.md is lean (~1,500-2,000 words), detailed content in references/
6. **Check references**: All referenced files exist
7. **Validate examples**: Examples are complete and correct
8. **Test scripts**: Scripts are executable and work correctly

**Use the skill-reviewer agent:**
```
Ask: "Review my skill and check if it follows best practices"
```

The skill-reviewer agent will check description quality, content organization, and progressive disclosure.

### Step 6: Iterate

After testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.

**Iteration workflow:**
1. Use the skill on real tasks
2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies
3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated
4. Implement changes and test again

**Common improvements:**
- Strengthen trigger phrases in description
- Move long sections from SKILL.md to references/
- Add missing examples or scripts
- Clarify ambiguous instructions
- Add edge case handling

## Plugin-Specific Considerations

### Skill Location in Plugins

Plugin skills live in the plugin's `skills/` directory:

```
my-plugin/
├── .codebuddy-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json
├── commands/
├── agents/
└── skills/
    └── my-skill/
        ├── SKILL.md
        ├── references/
        ├── examples/
        └── scripts/
```

### Auto-Discovery

CodeBuddy Code automatically discovers skills:
- Scans `skills/` directory
- Finds subdirectories containing `SKILL.md`
- Loads skill metadata (name + description) always
- Loads SKILL.md body when skill triggers
- Loads references/examples when needed

### No Packaging Needed

Plugin skills are distributed as part of the plugin, not as separate ZIP files. Users get skills when they install the plugin.

### Testing in Plugins

Test skills by installing plugin locally:

```bash
# Test with --plugin-dir
cc --plugin-dir /path/to/plugin

# Ask questions that should trigger the skill
# Verify skill loads correctly
```

## Examples from Plugin-Dev

Study the skills in this plugin as examples of best practices:

**hook-development skill:**
- Excellent trigger phrases: "create a hook", "add a PreToolUse hook", etc.
- Lean SKILL.md (1,651 words)
- 3 references/ files for detailed content
- 3 examples/ of working hooks
- 3 scripts/ utilities

**agent-development skill:**
- Strong triggers: "create an agent", "agent frontmatter", etc.
- Focused SKILL.md (1,438 words)
- References include the AI generation prompt from CodeBuddy Code
- Complete agent examples

**plugin-settings skill:**
- Specific triggers: "plugin settings", ".local.md files", "YAML frontmatter"
- References show real implementations (multi-agent-swarm, ralph-loop)
- Working parsing scripts

Each demonstrates progressive disclosure and strong triggering.

## Progressive Disclosure in Practice

### What Goes in SKILL.md

**Include (always loaded when skill triggers):**
- Core concepts and overview
- Essential procedures and workflows
- Quick reference tables
- Pointers to references/examples/scripts
- Most common use cases

**Keep under 3,000 words, ideally 1,500-2,000 words**

### What Goes in references/

**Move to references/ (loaded as needed):**
- Detailed patterns and advanced techniques
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Migration guides
- Edge cases and troubleshooting
- Extensive examples and walkthroughs

**Each reference file can be large (2,000-5,000+ words)**

### What Goes in examples/

**Working code examples:**
- Complete, runnable scripts
- Configuration files
- Template files
- Real-world usage examples

**Users can copy and adapt these directly**

### What Goes in scripts/

**Utility scripts:**
- Validation tools
- Testing helpers
- Parsing utilities
- Automation scripts

**Should be executable and documented**

## Writing Style Requirements

### Imperative/Infinitive Form

Write using verb-first instructions, not second person:

**Correct (imperative):**
```
To create a hook, define the event type.
Configure the MCP server with authentication.
Validate settings before use.
```

**Incorrect (second person):**
```
You should create a hook by defining the event type.
You need to configure the MCP server.
You must validate settings before use.
```

### Third-Person in Description

The frontmatter description must use third person:

**Correct:**
```yaml
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "create X", "configure Y"...
```

**Incorrect:**
```yaml
description: Use this skill when you want to create X...
description: Load this skill when user asks...
```

### Objective, Instructional Language

Focus on what to do, not who should do it:

**Correct:**
```
Parse the frontmatter using sed.
Extract fields with grep.
Validate values before use.
```

**Incorrect:**
```
You can parse the frontmatter...
CodeBuddy should extract fields...
The user might validate values...
```

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing a skill:

**Structure:**
- [ ] SKILL.md file exists with valid YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Frontmatter has `name` and `description` fields
- [ ] Markdown body is present and substantial
- [ ] Referenced files actually exist

**Description Quality:**
- [ ] Uses third person ("This skill should be used when...")
- [ ] Includes specific trigger phrases users would say
- [ ] Lists concrete scenarios ("create X", "configure Y")
- [ ] Not vague or generic

**Content Quality:**
- [ ] SKILL.md body uses imperative/infinitive form
- [ ] Body is focused and lean (1,500-2,000 words ideal, <5k max)
- [ ] Detailed content moved to references/
- [ ] Examples are complete and working
- [ ] Scripts are executable and documented

**Progressive Disclosure:**
- [ ] Core concepts in SKILL.md
- [ ] Detailed docs in references/
- [ ] Working code in examples/
- [ ] Utilities in scripts/
- [ ] SKILL.md references these resources

**Testing:**
- [ ] Skill triggers on expected user queries
- [ ] Content is helpful for intended tasks
- [ ] No duplicated information across files
- [ ] References load when needed

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Weak Trigger Description

❌ **Bad:**
```yaml
description: Provides guidance for working with hooks.
```

**Why bad:** Vague, no specific trigger phrases, not third person

✅ **Good:**
```yaml
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "create a hook", "add a PreToolUse hook", "validate tool use", or mentions hook events. Provides comprehensive hooks API guidance.
```

**Why good:** Third person, specific phrases, concrete scenarios

### Mistake 2: Too Much in SKILL.md

❌ **Bad:**
```
skill-name/
└── SKILL.md  (8,000 words - everything in one file)
```

**Why bad:** Bloats context when skill loads, detailed content always loaded

✅ **Good:**
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md  (1,800 words - core essentials)
└── references/
    ├── patterns.md (2,500 words)
    └── advanced.md (3,700 words)
```

**Why good:** Progressive disclosure, detailed content loaded only when needed

### Mistake 3: Second Person Writing

❌ **Bad:**
```markdown
You should start by reading the configuration file.
You need to validate the input.
You can use the grep tool to search.
```

**Why bad:** Second person, not imperative form

✅ **Good:**
```markdown
Start by reading the configuration file.
Validate the input before processing.
Use the grep tool to search for patterns.
```

**Why good:** Imperative form, direct instructions

### Mistake 4: Missing Resource References

❌ **Bad:**
```markdown
# SKILL.md

[Core content]

[No mention of references/ or examples/]
```

**Why bad:** CodeBuddy doesn't know references exist

✅ **Good:**
```markdown
# SKILL.md

[Core content]

## Additional Resources

### Reference Files
- **`references/patterns.md`** - Detailed patterns
- **`references/advanced.md`** - Advanced techniques

### Examples
- **`examples/script.sh`** - Working example
```

**Why good:** CodeBuddy knows where to find additional information

## Quick Reference

### Minimal Skill

```
skill-name/
└── SKILL.md
```

Good for: Simple knowledge, no complex resources needed

### Standard Skill (Recommended)

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── references/
│   └── detailed-guide.md
└── examples/
    └── working-example.sh
```

Good for: Most plugin skills with detailed documentation

### Complete Skill

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── references/
│   ├── patterns.md
│   └── advanced.md
├── examples/
│   ├── example1.sh
│   └── example2.json
└── scripts/
    └── validate.sh
```

Good for: Complex domains with validation utilities

## Best Practices Summary

✅ **DO:**
- Use third-person in description ("This skill should be used when...")

# Plugin Creation Workflow

Guide the user through creating a complete, high-quality CodeBuddy Code plugin from initial concept to tested implementation. Follow a systematic approach: understand requirements, design components, clarify details, implement following best practices, validate, and test.

## Core Principles

- **Ask clarifying questions**: Identify all ambiguities about plugin purpose, triggering, scope, and components. Ask specific, concrete questions rather than making assumptions. Wait for user answers before proceeding with implementation.
- **Load relevant skills**: Use the Skill tool to load plugin-dev skills when needed (plugin-structure, hook-development, agent-development, etc.)
- **Use specialized agents**: Leverage agent-creator, plugin-validator, and skill-reviewer agents for AI-assisted development
- **Follow best practices**: Apply patterns from plugin-dev's own implementation
- **Progressive disclosure**: Create lean skills with references/examples
- **Use TodoWrite**: Track all progress throughout all phases

**Initial request:** $ARGUMENTS

---

## Phase 1: Discovery

**Goal**: Understand what plugin needs to be built and what problem it solves

**Actions**:
1. Create todo list with all 7 phases
2. If plugin purpose is clear from arguments:
   - Summarize understanding
   - Identify plugin type (integration, workflow, analysis, toolkit, etc.)
3. If plugin purpose is unclear, ask user:
   - What problem does this plugin solve?
   - Who will use it and when?
   - What should it do?
   - Any similar plugins to reference?
4. Summarize understanding and confirm with user before proceeding

**Output**: Clear statement of plugin purpose and target users

---

## Phase 2: Component Planning

**Goal**: Determine what plugin components are needed

**MUST load plugin-structure skill** using Skill tool before this phase.

**Actions**:
1. Load plugin-structure skill to understand component types
2. Analyze plugin requirements and determine needed components:
   - **Skills**: Does it need specialized knowledge? (hooks API, MCP patterns, etc.)
   - **Commands**: User-initiated actions? (deploy, configure, analyze)
   - **Agents**: Autonomous tasks? (validation, generation, analysis)
   - **Hooks**: Event-driven automation? (validation, notifications)
   - **MCP**: External service integration? (databases, APIs)
   - **Settings**: User configuration? (.local.md files)
3. For each component type needed, identify:
   - How many of each type
   - What each one does
   - Rough triggering/usage patterns
4. Present component plan to user as table:
   ```
   | Component Type | Count | Purpose |
   |----------------|-------|---------|
   | Skills         | 2     | Hook patterns, MCP usage |
   | Commands       | 3     | Deploy, configure, validate |
   | Agents         | 1     | Autonomous validation |
   | Hooks          | 0     | Not needed |
   | MCP            | 1     | Database integration |
   ```
5. Get user confirmation or adjustments

**Output**: Confirmed list of components to create

---

## Phase 3: Detailed Design & Clarifying Questions

**Goal**: Specify each component in detail and resolve all ambiguities

**CRITICAL**: This is one of the most important phases. DO NOT SKIP.

**Actions**:
1. For each component in the plan, identify underspecified aspects:
   - **Skills**: What triggers them? What knowledge do they provide? How detailed?
   - **Commands**: What arguments? What tools? Interactive or automated?
   - **Agents**: When to trigger (proactive/reactive)? What tools? Output format?
   - **Hooks**: Which events? Prompt or command based? Validation criteria?
   - **MCP**: What server type? Authentication? Which tools?
   - **Settings**: What fields? Required vs optional? Defaults?

2. **Present all questions to user in organized sections** (one section per component type)

3. **Wait for answers before proceeding to implementation**

4. If user says "whatever you think is best", provide specific recommendations and get explicit confirmation

**Example questions for a skill**:
- What specific user queries should trigger this skill?
- Should it include utility scripts? What functionality?
- How detailed should the core SKILL.md be vs references/?
- Any real-world examples to include?

**Example questions for an agent**:
- Should this agent trigger proactively after certain actions, or only when explicitly requested?
- What tools does it need (Read, Write, Bash, etc.)?
- What should the output format be?
- Any specific quality standards to enforce?

**Output**: Detailed specification for each component

---

## Phase 4: Plugin Structure Creation

**Goal**: Create plugin directory structure and manifest

**Actions**:
1. Determine plugin name (kebab-case, descriptive)
2. Choose plugin location:
   - Ask user: "Where should I create the plugin?"
   - Offer options: current directory, ../new-plugin-name, custom path
3. Create directory structure using bash:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p plugin-name/.codebuddy-plugin
   mkdir -p plugin-name/skills     # if needed
   mkdir -p plugin-name/commands   # if needed
   mkdir -p plugin-name/agents     # if needed
   mkdir -p plugin-name/hooks      # if needed
   ```
4. Create plugin.json manifest using Write tool:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "plugin-name",
     "version": "0.1.0",
     "description": "[brief description]",
     "author": {
       "name": "[author from user or default]",
       "email": "[email or default]"
     }
   }
   ```
5. Create README.md template
6. Create .gitignore if needed (for .codebuddy/*.local.md, etc.)
7. Initialize git repo if creating new directory

**Output**: Plugin directory structure created and ready for components

---

## Phase 5: Component Implementation

**Goal**: Create each component following best practices

4. Implement settings reading in hooks/commands as needed
5. Add to .gitignore: `.codebuddy/*.local.md`

**Progress tracking**: Update todos as each component is completed

**Output**: All plugin components implemented

---

## Phase 6: Validation & Quality Check

**Goal**: Ensure plugin meets quality standards and works correctly

**Actions**:
1. **Run plugin-validator agent**:
   - Use plugin-validator agent to comprehensively validate plugin
   - Check: manifest, structure, naming, components, security
   - Review validation report

2. **Fix critical issues**:
   - Address any critical errors from validation
   - Fix any warnings that indicate real problems

3. **Review with skill-reviewer** (if plugin has skills):
   - For each skill, use skill-reviewer agent
   - Check description quality, progressive disclosure, writing style
   - Apply recommendations

4. **Test agent triggering** (if plugin has agents):
   - For each agent, verify <example> blocks are clear
   - Check triggering conditions are specific
   - Run validate-agent.sh on agent files

5. **Test hook configuration** (if plugin has hooks):
   - Run validate-hook-schema.sh on hooks/hooks.json
   - Test hook scripts with test-hook.sh
   - Verify ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT} usage

6. **Present findings**:
   - Summary of validation results
   - Any remaining issues
   - Overall quality assessment

7. **Ask user**: "Validation complete. Issues found: [count critical], [count warnings]. Would you like me to fix them now, or proceed to testing?"

**Output**: Plugin validated and ready for testing

---

## Phase 7: Testing & Verification

**Goal**: Test that plugin works correctly in CodeBuddy Code

**Actions**:
1. **Installation instructions**:
   - Show user how to test locally:
     ```bash
     cc --plugin-dir /path/to/plugin-name
     ```
   - Or copy to `.codebuddy-plugin/` for project testing

2. **Verification checklist** for user to perform:
   - [ ] Skills load when triggered (ask questions with trigger phrases)
   - [ ] Commands appear in `/help` and execute correctly
   - [ ] Agents trigger on appropriate scenarios
   - [ ] Hooks activate on events (if applicable)
   - [ ] MCP servers connect (if applicable)
   - [ ] Settings files work (if applicable)

3. **Testing recommendations**:
   - For skills: Ask questions using trigger phrases from descriptions
   - For commands: Run `/plugin-name:command-name` with various arguments
   - For agents: Create scenarios matching agent examples
   - For hooks: Use `codebuddy --debug` to see hook execution
   - For MCP: Use `/mcp` to verify servers and tools

4. **Ask user**: "I've prepared the plugin for testing. Would you like me to guide you through testing each component, or do you want to test it yourself?"

5. **If user wants guidance**, walk through testing each component with specific test cases

**Output**: Plugin tested and verified working

---

## Phase 8: Documentation & Next Steps

**Goal**: Ensure plugin is well-documented and ready for distribution

**Actions**:
1. **Verify README completeness**:
   - Check README has: overview, features, installation, prerequisites, usage
   - For MCP plugins: Document required environment variables
   - For hook plugins: Explain hook activation
   - For settings: Provide configuration templates

2. **Add marketplace entry** (if publishing):
   - Show user how to add to marketplace.json

     - Key files and their purposes
     - Total file count and structure
   - Next steps:
     - Testing recommendations
     - Publishing to marketplace (if desired)
     - Iteration based on usage

4. **Suggest improvements** (optional):
   - Additional components that could enhance plugin
   - Integration opportunities
   - Testing strategies

**Output**: Complete, documented plugin ready for use or publication

- **Use specialized agents** (agent-creator, plugin-validator, skill-reviewer)
- **Ask for user confirmation** at key decision points
- **Follow plugin-dev's own patterns** as reference examples
- **Apply best practices**:
  - Third-person descriptions for skills
  - Imperative form in skill bodies
  - Commands written FOR CodeBuddy
  - Strong trigger phrases
  - ${CODEBUDDY_PLUGIN_ROOT} for portability
  - Progressive disclosure
  - Security-first (HTTPS, no hardcoded credentials)

### Key Decision Points (Wait for User)

1. After Phase 1: Confirm plugin purpose
2. After Phase 2: Approve component plan
3. After Phase 3: Proceed to implementation
4. After Phase 6: Fix issues or proceed
5. After Phase 7: Continue to documentation

### Skills to Load by Phase

- **Phase 2**: plugin-structure
- **Phase 5**: skill-development, command-development, agent-development, hook-development, mcp-integration, plugin-settings (as needed)
- **Phase 6**: (agents will use skills automatically)

### Quality Standards

Every component must meet these standards:
- ✅ Follows plugin-dev's proven patterns
- ✅ Uses correct naming conventions
- ✅ Has strong trigger conditions (skills/agents)
- ✅ Includes working examples
- ✅ Properly documented
- ✅ Validated with utilities
- ✅ Tested in CodeBuddy Code

## Example Workflow

### User Request
"Create a plugin for managing database migrations"

### Phase 1: Discovery
- Understand: Migration management, database schema versioning
- Confirm: User wants to create, run, rollback migrations

### Phase 2: Component Planning
- Skills: 1 (migration best practices)
- Commands: 3 (create-migration, run-migrations, rollback)
- Agents: 1 (migration-validator)
- MCP: 1 (database connection)

### Phase 3: Clarifying Questions
- Which databases? (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
- Migration file format? (SQL, code-based?)
- Should agent validate before applying?
- What MCP tools needed? (query, execute, schema)

### Phase 4-8: Implementation, Validation, Testing, Documentation

---

**Begin with Phase 1: Discovery**
